&quot;We find in ancient story wonders many told,<br />

Of joyances and high-tides, of weeping and of woe,<br />

Of noble reckon striving, mote ye now wonders know.&quot;<br />

<h2>STRUGGLING IN THE WORLD.</h2>

<p>Do you know where it is -- the Hollow Land?</p>

<p>

I have been looking for it now so long, trying to find it again the 
Hollow Land for there I saw my love first.</p>

<p>

I wish to tell you how I found it first of all; but I am old, my memory 
fails me: you must wait and let me think if I perchance can tell you 
how it happened. Yea, in my ears is a confused noise of trumpet-blasts 
singing over desolate moors, in my ears and eyes a clashing and 
clanging of horse-hoofs, a ringing and glittering of steel; drawn-back 
lips, set teeth, shouts, shrieks, and curses.</p>

<p>

How was it that no one of us ever found it till that day? for it is 
near our country: but what time have we to look for it, or any good 
thing; with such biting carking cares hemming us in on every side-cares 
about great things-mighty things: mighty things, 0 my brothers! or 
rather little things enough, if we only knew it. Lives passed in 
turmoil, in making one another unhappy; in bitterest misunderstanding 
of our brothers' hearts, making those sad whom God has not made 
sad, alas, alas! What chance for any of us to find the Hollow Land? What 
time even to look for it?</p>

<p>

Yet who has not dreamed of it? Who, half miserable yet the while, for 
that he knows it is but a dream, has not felt the cool waves round his 
feet, the roses crowning him, and through the leaves of beech and lime 
the many whispering winds of the Hollow Land?</p>

<p>

Now, my name was Florian, and my house was the house of the Lilies; and 
of that house was my father lord, and after him my eldest brother 
Amald; and me they called Florian de Liliis.</p>

<p>

Moreover, when my father was dead, there arose a feud between the 
Lilies' house and Red Harald; and this that follows is the history of 
it.</p>

<p>

Lady Swanhilda, Red Harald's mother, was a widow, with one son. Red
Harald; and when she had been in widowhood two years, being of
princely blood, and besides comely and fierce. King Urrayne sent to
demand her in marriage. And I remember seeing the procession leaving
the town, when I was quite a child; and many young knights and squires
attended the Lady Swanhilda as pages, and amongst them, Amald, my
eldest brother.</p>

<p>

And as I gazed out of the window, I saw him walking by the side of her 
horse, dressed in white and gold very delicately; but as he went it 
chanced that he stumbled. Now he was one of those that held a golden 
canopy over the lady's head, so that it now sunk into wrinkles, and the 
lady had to bow her head full low, and even then the gold brocade 
caught in one of the long slim gold flowers that were wrought round 
about the crown she wore. She flushed up in her rage, and her smooth 
face went suddenly into the carven wrinkles of a wooden water-spout, 
and she caught at the brocade with her left hand, and pulled it away 
furiously, so that the warp and woof were twisted out of their place, 
and many gold threads were left dangling about the crown; but Swanhilda 
stared about when she rose, then smote my brother across the mouth with 
her gilded sceptre, and the red blood flowed all about his garments; 
yet he only turned exceeding pale, and dared say no word, though he was 
heir to the house of the Lilies: but my small heart swelled with rage, 
and I vowed revenge, and, as it seems, he did too.</p>

<p>

So when Swanhilda had been queen three years, she suborned many of King 
Urrayne's knights and lords, and slew her husband as he slept, and 
reigned in his stead. And her son, Harald, grew up to manhood, and was 
counted a strong knight, and well spoken of, by then I first put on my 
armour.</p>

<p>

Then, one night, as I lay dreaming, I felt a hand laid on my face, and 
starting up saw Arnald before me fully armed. He said, &quot;Florian, 
rise and arm.&quot;</p>

<p>

I did so, all but my helm, as he was.</p>

<p>

He kissed me on the forehead; his lips felt hot and dry; and when they 
bought torches, and I could see his face plainly, I saw he was very 
pale. He said: &quot;Do you remember, Florian, this day sixteen years 
ago? It is a long time, but I shall never forget it unless this night 
blots out its memory.&quot;</p>

<p>

I knew what he meant, and because my heart was wicked, I rejoiced 
exceedingly at the thought of vengeance, so that I could not speak, but 
only laid my palm across his lips.</p>

<p>

&quot;Good; you have a good memory, Florian. See now, I waited long and 
long: I said at first, I forgive her; but when the news came concerning 
the death of the king, and how that she was shameless, I said I will 
take it as a sign, if God does not punish her within certain years, 
that he means me to do so; and I have been watching and watching now 
these two years for an opportunity, and behold it is come at last; and 
I think God has certainly given her into OUR hands, for she rests this 
night, this very Christmas eve, at a small walled town on the frontier, 
not two hours' gallop from this; they keep little ward there, and the 
night is wild: moreover, the prior of a certain house of monks, just 
without the walls, is my fast friend in this matter, for she has done 
him some great injury. In the courtyard below a hundred and fifty 
knights and squires, all faithful and true, are waiting for us: one 
moment and we shall be gone.&quot;</p>

<p>

Then we both knelt down, and prayed God to give her into our hands: we 
put on our helms, and went down into the courtyard.</p>

<p>

It was the first time I expected to use a sharp sword in anger, and I 
was full of joy as the muffled thunder of our horse-hoofs rolled 
through the bitter winter night.</p>

<p>

In about an hour and a half we had crossed the frontier, and in half an 
hour more the greater part bad halted in a wood near the Abbey, while I 
and a few others went up to the Abbey gates, and knocked loudly four 
times with my sword-hilt, stamping on the ground meantime. A long, low 
whistle answered me from within, which I in my turn answered: then the 
wicket opened, and a monk came out, holding a lantern. He seemed yet in 
the prime of life, and was a tall, powerful man. He held the lantern to 
my face, then smiled, and said, &quot;The banners hang low.&quot; I 
gave the countersign, &quot;The crest is lopped off.&quot; &quot;Good 
my son,&quot; said he; &quot;the ladders are within here. I dare not 
trust any of the brethren to carry them for you, though they love not 
the witch either, but are timorsome.&quot;</p>

<p>

&quot;No matter,&quot; I said, &quot;I have men here.&quot; So they 
entered and began to shoulder the tall ladders: the prior was very 
busy. &quot;You will find them just the right length, my son, trust me 
for that.&quot; He seemed quite a jolly, pleasant man, I could not 
understand his nursing furious revenge; but his face darkened strangely 
whenever he happened to mention her name.</p>

<p>

As we were starting he came and stood outside the gate, and putting his 
lantern down that the light of it might not confuse his sight, looked 
earnestly into the night, then said: &quot;The wind has fallen, the 
snow flakes get thinner and smaller every moment, in an hour it will be 
freezing hard, and will be quite clear; everything depends'upon the 
surprise being complete; stop a few minutes yet, my son.&quot; He went 
away chuckling, and returned presently with two more sturdy monks 
carrying something: they threw their burdens down before my feet, they 
consisted of all the white albs in the abbey: &quot;There, trust an old 
man, who has seen more than one stricken fight in his carnal days; let 
the men who scale the walls put these over their arms, and they will 
not be seen in the least. God make your sword sharp, my son.&quot;</p>

<p>So we departed, and when I met Amald again, he said that what the 
prior had done was well thought of; so we agreed that I should take 
thirty men, an old squire of our house, well skilled in war, along with 
them, scale the walls as quietly as possible, and open the gates to the 
rest.</p>

<p>

I set off accordingly, after that with low laughing we had put the albs 
all over us, wrapping the ladders also in white. Then we crept very 
warily and slowly up to the wall; the moat was frozen over, and on the 
ice the snow lay quite thick; we all thought that the guards must be 
careless enough, when they did not even take the trouble to break the 
ice in the moat So we listened- there was no sound at all, the 
Christmas midnight mass had long ago been over, it was nearly three 
o'clock, and the moon began to clear, there was scarce any snow falling 
now, only a flake or two from some low hurrying cloud or other: the 
wind sighed gently about the round towers there, but it was bitter 
cold, for it had begun to freeze again; we listened for some minutes, 
about a quarter of an hour I think, then at a sign from me, they raised 
the ladders carefully, muffled as they were at the top with swathings 
of wool. I mounted first, old Squire Hugh followed last; noiselessly we 
ascended, and soon stood altogether on the walls; then we carefully 
lowered the ladders again with long ropes; we got our swords and axes 
from out of the folds of our priests' raiments, and set forward, till 
we reached the first tower along the wall; the door was open, in the 
chamber at the top there was a fire slowly smouldering, nothing else; 
we passed through it, and began to go down the spiral staircase, I 
first, with my axe shortened in my hand.-&quot;What if we were 
surprised there,&quot; I thought, and I longed to be out in the air 
again;-&quot;What if the door were fast at the bottom.&quot; </p>

<p>

As we passed the second chamber, we heard some one within snoring 
loudly: I looked in quietly, and saw a big man with long black hair, 
that fell off his pillow and swept the ground, lying snoring, with his 
nose turned up and his mouth open, but he seemed so sound asleep that 
we did not stop to slay him. Praise be! The door was open, without even 
a whispered word, without a pause, we went on along the streets, on the 
side that the drift had been on, because our garments were white, for 
the wind being very strong all that day, the houses on that side had 
caught in their cornices and carvings, and on the rough stone and wood 
of them, so much snow, that except here and there where the black walls 
grinned out, they were quite white; no man saw us as we stole along, 
noiselessly because of the snow, till we stood within 100 yards of the 
gates and their house of guard. And we stood because we heard the voice 
of some one singing:</p>

<p>

&quot;Queen Mary's crown was gold,<br />

King Joseph's crown was red,<br />

But Jesus' crown was diamond<br />

That lit up all the bed<br />

Mariae Virginis&quot;</p>

<p>

So they had some guards after all; this was clearly the sentinel that 
sang to keep the ghosts off;-Now for a fight.-We drew nearer, a few 
yards nearer, then stopped to free ourselves from our monks' clothes. 
</p>

<p>

&quot;Ships sail through the Heaven<br />

With red banners dress'd,<br />

Carrying the planets seven<br />

To see the white breast<br />

Mariae Virginis&quot;</p>

<p>

Thereat he must have seen the waving of some alb or other as it 
shivered down to the ground, for his spear fell with a thud, and he 
seemed to be standing open-mouthed, thinking something about ghosts; 
then, plucking up heart of grace, he roared out like ten bull-calves, 
and dashed into the guard-house.</p>

<p>

We followed smartly, but without hurry, and came up to the door of it 
just as some dozen half-armed men came tumbling out under our axes: 
thereupon, while our men slew them, I blew a great blast upon my horn, 
and Hugh with some others drew bolt and bar and swung the gates wide 
open.</p>

<p>Then the men in the guard-house understood they were taken in a 
trap, and began to stir with great confusion; so lest they should get 
quite waked and armed, I left Hugh at the gates with ten men, and 
myself led the rest into that house. There while we slew all those that 
yielded not, came Arnald with the others, bringing our horses with 
them; then all the enemy threw their arms down. And we counted our 
prisoners and found them over fourscore; therefore, not knowing what to 
do with them (for they were too many to guard, and it seemed unknightly 
to slay them all), we sent up some bowmen to the walls, and turning our 
prisoners out of gates, bid them run for their lives, which they did 
fast enough, not knowing our numbers, and our men sent a few flights of 
arrows among them that they might not be undeceived. </p>

<p>

Then the one or two prisoners that we had left, told us, when we had 
crossed our axes over their heads, that the people of the good town 
would not willingly fight us, in that they hated the queen; that she 
was guarded at the palace by some fifty knights, and that beside, there 
were no others to oppose us in the town; so we set out for the palace, 
spear in hand. </p>

<p>

We had not gone far, before we heard some knights coming, and soon, in 
a turn of the long street, we saw them riding towards us; when they 
caught sight of us they seemed astonished, drew rein, and stood in some 
confusion. </p>

<p>

We did not slacken our pace for an instant, but rode right at them with 
a yell, to which I lent myself with all my heart.</p>

<p>

After all they did not run away, but waited for us with their spears 
held out; I missed the man I had marked, or hit him rather just on the 
top of the helm; he bent back, and the spear slipped over his head, but 
my horse still kept on, and I felt presently such a crash that I reeled 
in my saddle, and felt mad. He had lashed out at me with his sword as I 
came on, hitting me in the ribs (for my arm was raised), but only 
flatlings.  </p>

<p>

I was quite wild with rage, I turned, almost fell upon him, caught him 
by the neck with both hands, and threw him under the horse-hoofs, 
sighing with fury: I heard Arnald's voice close to me, &quot;Well 
fought, Florian&quot;: and I saw his great stern face bare among the 
iron, for he had made a vow in remembrance of that blow always to fight 
unhelmed; I saw his great sword swinging, in wide gyres, and hissing as 
it started up, just as if it were alive and liked it. </p>

<p>

So joy filled all my soul, and I fought with my heart, till the big axe 
I swung felt like nothing but a little hammer in my hand, except for 
its bitterness: and as for the enemy, they went down like grass, so 
that we destroyed them utterly, for those knights would neither yield 
nor fly, but died as they stood, so that some fifteen of our men also 
died there. </p>

<p>

Then at last we came to the palace, where some grooms and such like 
kept the gates armed, but some ran, and some we took prisoners, one of 
whom died for sheer terror in our hands, being stricken by no wound; 
for he thought we would eat him.</p>

<p>

These prisoners we questioned concerning the queen, and so entered the 
great hall. There Arnald sat down in the throne on the dais, and laid 
his naked sword before him on the table: and on each side of him sat 
such knights as there was room for, and the others stood round about, 
while I took ten men, and went to look for Swanhilda. </p>

<p>

I found her soon, sitting by herself in a gorgeous chamber. I almost 
pitied her when I saw her looking so utterly desolate and despairing; 
her beauty too had faded, deep lines cut through her face. But when I 
entered she knew who I was, and her look of intense hatred was so 
fiend-like, that it changed my pity into horror of her.</p>

<p>&quot;Knight&quot;, she said &quot;who are you, and what do you 
want, thus discourteously entering my chamber?&quot; </p>

<p>

&quot;I am Florian de Liliis, and I am to conduct you to 
judgment.&quot;</p>

<p>

She sprang up, &quot;Curse you and your whole house, you I hate worse 
than any -- girl's face -- guards! guards!&quot; and she stamped on the 
ground, her veins on the forehead swelled, her eyes grew round and 
flamed out, as she kept crying for her guards, stamping the while, for 
she seemed quite mad.</p>

<p>

Then at last she remembered that she was in the power of her enemies, 
she sat down, and lay with her face between her hands, and wept 
passionately.</p>

<p>

&quot;Witch,&quot; I said between my closed teeth, &quot;will you come, 
or must we carry you down to the great hall?&quot;</p>

<p>

Neither would she come, but sat there, clutching at her dress and 
tearing her hair.</p>

<p>

Then I said, &quot;Bind her, and carry her down.&quot; And they did 
so.</p>

<p>

I watched Arnald as we came in, there was no triumph on his stern white 
face, but resolution enough, he had made up his mind.</p>

<p>

They placed her on a seat in the midst of the hall over against the 
dais. He said, &quot;Unbind her, Florian.&quot; They did so, she raised 
her face, and glared defiance at us all, as though she would die 
queenly after all.</p>

<p>

Then rose up Arnald and said, &quot;Queen Swanhilda, we judge you 
guilty of death, and because you are a queen and of a noble house, you 
shall be slain by my knightly sword, and I will even take the reproach 
of slaying a woman, for no other hand than mine shall deal the 
blow.&quot;</p>

<p>

Then she said, &quot;0 false knight, show your warrant from God, man, 
or devil.&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;This warrant from God, Swanhilda,&quot; he said, holding up his 
sword, &quot;listen!  Fifteen years ago, when I was just winning my 
spurs, you struck me, disgracing me before all the people; you cursed 
me, and mean that curse well enough. Men of the house of the Lilies, 
what sentence for that?&quot;</p>

<p>

&quot;Death!&quot; they said.</p>

<p>

&quot;Listen!  Afterwards you slew my cousin, your husband, 
treacherously, in the most cursed way, stabbing him in the throat, as 
the stars in the canopy above him looked down on the shut eyes of him. 
Men of the house of Lily, what sentence for that?&quot;</p>

<p>

&quot;Death!&quot; they said.</p>

<p>

&quot;Do you hear them. Queen? There is warrant from man; for the 
devil, I do not reverence him enough to take warrant from him, but, as 
I look at that face of yours, I think that even he has left 
you.&quot;</p>

<p>

And indeed just then all her pride seemed to leave her, she fell from 
the chair, and wallowed on the ground moaning, she wept like a child, 
so that the tears lay on the oak floor; she prayed for another month of 
life; she came to me and kneeled, and kissed my feet, and prayed 
piteously, so that water ran out of her mouth.</p>

<p>

But I shuddered, and drew away; it was like hav ing an adder about one; 
I cou'd have pitied her had she died bravely, but for one like her to 
whine and whine!  Pah!</p>

<p>

Then from the dais rang Amald's voice terrible, much changed. &quot;Let 
there be an end of all this.&quot; And he took his sword and strode 
through the hall towards her; she rose from the ground and stood up, 
stooping a little,  her head sunk between her shoulders,  her black 
eyes turned up and gloaming, like a tigress about to spring. When he 
came within some six paces of her something in his eye daunted her, or 
perhaps the flashing of his terrible sword in the torch-light; she 
threw her arms up with a great shriek, and dashed screaming about the 
hall. Amald's lip never once curled with any scorn, no line in his face 
changed: he said, &quot;Bring her here and bind her.&quot;</p>

<p>

But when one came up to her to lay hold on her she first of all ran at 
him, hitting with her head in the belly. Then while he stood doubled up 
for want of breath, and staring with his head up, she caught his sword 
from the girdle, and cut him across the shoulders, and many others she 
wounded sorely before they took her. Then Arnald stood by the chair to 
which she was bound, and poised his sword, and there was a great
silence.</p>

<p>

Then he said, &quot;Men of the House of the Lilies, do you justify me 
in this, shall she die?&quot; Straightway rang a great shout through 
the hall, but before it died away the sword had swept round, and 
therewithal was there no such thing as Swanhilda left upon the  earth, 
for in no battle-field had Arnald struck truer blow.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the few servants of the palace and said, &quot;Go 
now, bury this accursed woman, for she is a king's daughter.&quot; Then 
to us all, &quot;Now knights, to horse and away, that we may reach the 
good town by about dawn.&quot; So we mounted and rode off.</p>

<p>

What a strange Christmas-day that was, for there, about nine o'clock in 
the morning, rode Red Harald into the good town to demand vengeance; he 
went at once to the king, and the king promised that before nightfall 
that very day the matter should be judged; albeit the king feared 
somewhat, because every third man you met in the streets had a blue 
cross on his shoulder, and some likeness of a lily, cut out or painted, 
stuck in his hat; and this blue cross and lily were the bearings of our 
house, called &quot;De Liliis.&quot; Now we had seen Red Harald pass 
through the streets, with a white banner borne before him, to show that 
he came peaceably as for this time; but I know he was thinking of other 
things than peace.</p>

<p>

And he was called Red Harald first at this time, because over all his 
arms he wore a great scarlet cloth, that fell in heavy folds about his 
horse and all about him. Then, as he passed our house, some one pointed 
it out to him, rising there with its carving and its barred marble, but 
stronger than many a castle on the hill-tops, and its great overhanging 
battlement cast a mighty shadow down the wall and across the street; 
and above all rose the great tower, or banner floating proudly from the 
top, whereon was emblazoned on a white ground a blue cross, and on a 
blue ground four white lilies. And now faces were gazing from all the 
windows, and all the battlements were thronged; so Harald turned, and 
rising in his stirrups, shook his clenched fist at our house; 
natheless, as he did so, the east wind, coming down the street, caught 
up the corner of that scarlet cloth and drove it over his face, and 
therewithal disordering his long black hair, well nigh choked him, so 
that he bit both his hair and that cloth.</p>

<p>

So from base to cope rose a mighty shout of triumph and defiance, and 
he passed on.</p>

<p>

Then Arnald caused it to be cried, that all those who loved the good 
House of the Lilies should go to mass that morning in Saint Mary's 
Church, hard by our house. Now this church belonged to us, and the 
abbey that served it, and always we appointed the abbot of it on 
condition that our trumpets should sound all together when on high 
masses they sing the &quot;Gloria in Excelsis.&quot; It was the largest 
and most beautiful of all the churches in the town, and had two 
exceeding high towers, which you could see from far off, even when you 
saw not the town or any of its other towers: and in one of these towers 
were twelve great bells, named after the twelve Apostles, one name 
being written on each one of them; as Peter, Matthew, and so on; and in 
the other tower was one great bell only, much larger than any of the 
others, and which was called Mary. Now this bell was never rung but 
when our house was in great danger, and it had this legend on it, 
&quot;When Mary rings the earth shakes;&quot; and indeed from this we 
took our war cry, which was, &quot;Mary rings;&quot; somewhat 
justifiable indeed, for the last time that Mary rang, on that day 
before nightfall there were four thousand bodies to be buried, which 
bodies wore neither cross nor lily.</p>

<p>

So Arnald gave me in charge to tell the abbot to cause Mary to be 
tolled for an hour before mass that day.</p>

<p>

The abbot leaned on my shoulder as I stood within the tower and looked 
at the twelve monks laying their hands to the ropes. Far up in the 
dimness I saw the wheel before it began to swing round about; then it 
moved a little; the twelve men bent down to the earth and a roar rose 
that shook the tower from base to spirevane: backwards and forwards 
swept the wheel, as Mary now looked downwards towards earth, now looked 
up at the shadowy cone of the spire, shot across by bars of light from 
the dormers. </p>

<p>

And the thunder of Mary was caught up by the wind and carried through 
all the country; and when the good man heard it, he said goodbye to 
wife and child, slung his shield behind his back, and set forward with 
his spear sloped over his shoulder, and many a time, as he walked 
toward the good town, he tightened the belt that went about his waist, 
that he might stride the faster, so long and furiously did Mary 
toll.</p>

<p>

And before the great bell, Mary, had ceased ringing, all the ways were 
full of armed men.</p>

<p>

But at each door of the church of Saint Mary stood a row of men armed 
with axes, and when any came, meaning to go into the church, the two 
first of these would hold their axes (whose helves were about four feet 
long) over his head, and would ask him, &quot;Who went over the moon 
last night?&quot; then if he answered nothing or at random they would 
bid him turn back, which he for the more part would be ready enough to 
do; but some, striving to get through that row of men, were slain 
outright; but if he were one of those that were friends to the House of 
the Lilies he would answer to that question, &quot;Mary and 
John.&quot;</p>

<p>

By the time the mass began the whole church was full, and in the nave 
and transept thereof were three thousand men, all of our house and all 
armed. But Arnald and myself, and Squire Hugh, and some others sat 
under a gold-fringed canopy near the choir; and the abbot said mass, 
having his mitre on his head. Yet, as I watched him, it seemed to me 
that he must have something on beneath his priest's vestments, for he 
looked much fatter than usual, being really a tall lithe man.</p>

<p>

Now, as they sung the &quot;Kyrie,&quot; some one shouted from the
other end of the church, &quot;My lord Arnld, they are slaying our
people without;&quot; for, indeed, all the square about the church was
full of our people, who for the press had not been able to enter, and
were standing there in no small dread of what might come to pass.</p>

<p>

Then the abbot turned round from the altar, and began to fidget with 
the fastenings of his rich robes. And they made a lane for us up to the 
west door; then I put on my helm and we began to go up the nave, then 
suddenly the singing of the monks and all stopped. I heard a clinking 
and a buzz of voices in the choir. I turned, and saw that the bright 
noon sun was shining on the gold of the priest's vestments, as they lay 
on the floor, and on the mail that the priests carried.</p>

<p>

So we stopped, the choir gates swung open, and the abbot marched out at 
the head of <i>his</i> men, all fully armed, and began to strike up the 
psalm &quot;Exsurgat Deus.&quot;</p>

<p>

When we got to the west door, there was indeed a tumult, but as yet no
slaying; the square was all a-flicker with steel, and we beheld a
great body of knights, at the head of them Red Harald and the king,
standing over against us; but our people, pressed against the houses,
and into the comers of the square, were, some striving to enter the
doors, some beside themselves with rage, shouting out to the others to
charge; withal, some were pale and some were red with the blood that
had gathered to the wrathful faces of them.</p>

<p>

Then said Arnald to those about him, &quot;Lift me up.&quot; So they 
laid a great shield on two lances, and these four men carried, and 
thereon stood Arnald, and gazed about him.</p>

<p>

Now the king was unhelmed, and his white hair (for he was an old man) 
flowed down behind him on to his saddle; but Amaid's hair was cut 
short, and was red.</p>

<p>

And all the bells rang.</p>

<p>

Then the king said, &quot;0 Arnald of the Lilies, will you settle this 
quarrel by the judgment of God?&quot; And Amaid thrust up his chin, and 
said, &quot;Yea.&quot; &quot;How then,&quot; said the king, &quot;and 
where?&quot; &quot;Will it please you try now?&quot; said Arnald.</p>

<p>

Then the king understood what he meant, and took in his hand from 
behind tresses of his long white hair, twisting them round his hand in 
his wrath, but yet said no word, till I suppose his hair put him in 
mind of something, and he raised it in both his hands above his head, 
and shouted out aloud, &quot;0 knights, hearken to this traitor.&quot; 
Whereat, indeed, the lances began to move ominously. But Arnald 
spoke.</p>

<p>

&quot;0 you king and lords, what have we to do with you? Were we not 
free in the old time, up among the hills there? Wherefore give way, and 
we will go to the hills again; and if any man try to stop us, his blood 
be on his own head; wherefore now,&quot; (and he turned) &quot;all you 
House of the Lily, both soldiers and monks, let us go forth together 
fearing nothing, for I think there is not bone enough or muscle enough 
in these fellows here that have a king that they should stop us withal, 
but only skin and fat.&quot;</p>

<p>

And truly, no man dared to stop us, and we went.</p>
	

	<h2>FAILING IN THE WORLD</h2>

<p>Now at that time we drove cattle in Red Harald's land. And we took 
no hoof but from the Lords and rich men, but of these we had a mighty 
drove, both oxen and sheep, and horses, and besides, even hawks and 
hounds, and huntsman or two to take care of them.</p>

<p>

And, about noon, we drew away from the cornlands that lay beyond the 
pastures, and mingled with them, and reached a wide moor, which was 
called &quot;Goliath's Land.&quot; I scarce know why, except that it 
belonged neither to Red Harald or us, but was debatable.</p>

<p>

And the cattle began to go slowly, and our horses were tired, and the 
sun struck down very hot upon us, for there was no shadow, and the day 
was cloudless.</p>

<p>

All about the edge of the moor, except on the sidefrom which we had 
come was a rim of hills, not very high, but very rocky and steep, 
otherwise the moor itself was flat; and through these hills was one 
pass, guarded by our men, which pass led to the Hill castle of the 
Lilies.</p>

<p>

It was not wonderful, that of this moor many wild stories were told, 
being such a strange lonely place, some of them one knew, alas to be 
over true. In the old time, before we went to the good town, this moor 
had been the mustering place of our people, and our house had done 
deeds enough of blood and horror to turn our white lilies red, and our 
blue cross to a fiery one. But some of those wild tales I never 
believed; they had to do mostly with men losing their way without any 
apparent cause, (for there were plenty of landmarks,) finding some 
well-known spot, and then, just beyond it, a place they had never even 
dreamed of.</p>

<p>

&quot;Florian! FIorian!&quot; said Arnald, &quot;for God's sake stop! 
as every one else is stopping to look at the hills yonder; I always 
thought there was a curse upon us. What does God mean by shutting us up 
here? Look at the cattle; 0 Christ, they have found it out too! See, 
some of them are turning to run back again towards Harald's land. Oh! 
unhappy, unhappy, from that day forward!&quot;</p>

<p>

He leaned forward, rested his head on his horse's neck, and wept like a 
child. I felt so irritated with him, that I could almost have slain him 
then and there. Was he mad? had these wild doings of ours turned his 
strong wise head?</p>

<p>

&quot;Are you my brother Arnald, that I used to think such a grand man 
when I was a boy?&quot; I said, &quot;or are you changed too, like 
everybody, and everything else? What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>

&quot;Look! look!&quot; he said, grinding his teeth in agony. I raised 
my eyes: where was the one pass between the rim of stern rocks? 
Nothing: the enemy behind us- that grim wall in front: what wonder that 
each man looked in his fellow's face for help, and found it not. Yet I 
refused to believe that there was any troth either in the wild stories 
that I had heard when I was a boy, or in this story told me so clearly 
by my eyes now.</p>

<p>

I called out cheerily, &quot;Hugh, come here!&quot; He came. &quot;What 
do you think of this? Some mere dodge on Harald's part? Are we cut 
off?&quot; &quot;Think! Sir Florian? God forgive me for ever thinking 
at all; I have given up that long and long ago, because thirty years 
ago I thought this, that the House of Lilies would deserve anything in 
the way of bad fortune that God would send them: so I gave up thinking, 
and took to fighting. But if you think that Harald had anything to do 
with this, why-why-in God's name, I wish <i>I</i> could think 
so!&quot;</p>

<p>

I felt a dull weight on my heart. Had our house been the devil's 
servants all along? I thought we were God's servants.</p>

<p>

The day was very still, but what little wind there was, was at our 
backs. I watched Hugh's face, not being able to answer him. He was the 
cleverest man at war that I have known, either before or since that 
day; sharper than any hound in ear and scent, clearer sighted than any 
eagle; he was listening now intently. I saw a slight smile cross his 
face; heard  him mutter, &quot;Yes! I think so: verily that is better, 
a great deal better.&quot; Then he stood up in his stirrups, and 
shouted, &quot;Hurrah for the Lilies! Mary rings!&quot; &quot;Mary 
rings!&quot; I shouted, though I did not know the reason for his 
exultation: my brother lifted his head, and smiled too, grimly. Then as 
I listened I heard clearly the sound of a trumpet, and enemy's trumpet 
too.</p>

<p>

&quot;After all, it was only mist, or some such thing,&quot; I said, 
for the pass between the hills was clear enough now.</p>

<p>

&quot;Hurrah! only mist,&quot; said Amald, quite elated; &quot;Mary 
rings!&quot; and we all began to think of fighting: for after all what 
joy is equal to  that?</p>

<p>

There were five hundred of us; two hundred spears, the rest archers; 
and both archers and men at arms were picked men.</p>

<p>

&quot;How many of them are we to expect?&quot; said I. &quot;Not under 
a thousand, certainly, probably more, Sir Florian.&quot; (My brother 
Arnald, by the way, had knighted me before we left the good town, and 
Hugh liked to give me the handle to my name. How was it, by the way, 
that no one had ever made him a
knight?)</p>

<p>

&quot;Let every one look to his arms and horse, and come away from 
these silly cows' sons!&quot; shouted Arnald.</p>

<p>

Hugh said, &quot;They will be here in an hour, fair Sir.&quot;</p>

<p>

So we got clear of the cattle, and dismounted, and both ourselves took
food and drink, and our horses; afterwards we tightened our
saddle-girths, shook our great pots of helmets on, except Amald, whose
rustyred hair had been his only head-piece in battle for years and
years, and stood with our spears close by our horses, leaving room for
the archers to retreat between our ranks; and they got their arrows
ready, and planted their stakes before a little peat moss: and there
we waited, and saw their pennons at last floating high above the corn
of the fertile land, then heard their many horse-hoofs ring upon the
hard-parched moor, and the archers began to shoot.</p>

<p>It had been a strange battle; we had never fought better, and yet 
withal it had ended in a retreat; indeed all along every man but Arnald 
and myself, even Hugh, had been trying at least to get the enemy 
between him and the way toward the pass; and now we were all drifting 
that way, the enemy trying to cut us off, but never able to stop us, 
because he could only throw small bodies of men in our way, whom we 
scattered and put to flight in their turn.</p>

<p>

I never cared less for my life than then; indeed, in spite of all my 
boasting and hardness of belief, I should have been happy to have died, 
such a strange weight of apprehension was on me; and yet I got no 
scratch even. I had soon put off my great helm, and was fighting in my 
mail-coif only: and here I swear that three knights together charged 
me, aiming at my bare face, yet never touched me. For, as for one, I 
put his lance aside with my sword, and the other two in some most 
wonderful manner got their spears locked in each other's armour, and so 
had to submit to be knocked off their horses.</p>

<p>

And we still neared the pass, and began to see distinctly the ferns 
that grew on the rocks, and the fair country between the rift in them, 
spreading out there, blue-shadowed. Whereupon came a great rush of men 
of both sides, striking side blows at each other, spitting, cursing, 
and shrieking, as they tore away like a herd of wild  hogs. So, being 
careless of lfe, as I said, I drew rein, and turning my horse, waited 
quietly for them. And I knotted the reins, and laid them on the horse's 
neck, and stroked him, that he whinnied, then got both my hands to my 
sword.</p>
