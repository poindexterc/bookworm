<h2>CHAPTER I: OF GOLDEN WALTER AND HIS FATHER</h2>
<p>Awhile ago there was a young man dwelling in a great and 
goodly city by the sea which had to name Langton on 
Holm.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was but of five and twenty winters, a 
fair-faced man, yellow-haired, tall and strong; rather wiser than
foolisher than young men are mostly wont; a valiant youth, and a 
kind; not of many words but courteous of speech; no roisterer, 
nought masterful, but peaceable and knowing how to forbear: in a 
fray a perilous foe, and a trusty war-fellow.&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
father, with whom he was dwelling when this tale begins, was a 
great merchant, richer than a baron of the land, a head-man of 
the greatest of the Lineages of Langton, and a captain of the 
Porte; he was of the Lineage of the Goldings, therefore was he 
called Bartholomew Golden, and his son Golden Walter.</p>
<p>Now ye may well deem that such a youngling as this was looked 
upon by all as a lucky man without a lack; but there was this 
flaw in his lot, whereas he had fallen into the toils of love of 
a woman exceeding fair, and had taken her to wife, she nought 
unwilling as it seemed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they had been wedded
some six months he found by manifest tokens, that his fairness 
was not so much to her but that she must seek to the foulness of 
one worser than he in all ways; wherefore his rest departed from 
him, whereas he hated her for her untruth and her hatred of him; 
yet would the sound of her voice, as she came and went in the 
house, make his heart beat; and the sight of her stirred desire 
within him, so that he longed for her to be sweet and kind with 
him, and deemed that, might it be so, he should forget all the 
evil gone by.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was not so; for ever when she 
saw him, her face changed, and her hatred of him became manifest,
and howsoever she were sweet with others, with him she was hard 
and sour.</p>
<p>So this went on a while till the chambers of his 
father&rsquo;s house, yea the very streets of the city, became 
loathsome to him; and yet he called to mind that the world was 
wide and he but a young man.&nbsp;&nbsp; So on a day as he sat 
with his father alone, he spake to him and said: &ldquo;Father, I
was on the quays even now, and I looked on the ships that were 
nigh boun, and thy sign I saw on a tall ship that seemed to me 
nighest boun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it be long ere she 
sail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;that ship, which 
hight the Katherine, will they warp out of the haven in two 
days&rsquo; time.&nbsp;&nbsp; But why askest thou of 
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shortest word is best, father,&rdquo; said Walter, 
&ldquo;and this it is, that I would depart in the said ship and 
see other lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea and whither, son?&rdquo; said the merchant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither she goeth,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;for I am 
ill at ease at home, as thou wottest, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant held his peace awhile, and looked hard on his 
son, for there was strong love between them; but at last he said:
&ldquo;Well, son, maybe it were best for thee; but maybe also we 
shall not meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet if we do meet, father, then shalt thou see a new 
man in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bartholomew, &ldquo;at least I know 
on whom to lay the loss of thee, and when thou art gone, for thou
shalt have thine own way herein, she shall no longer abide in my 
house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, but it were for the strife that should 
arise thenceforth betwixt her kindred and ours, it should go 
somewhat worse with her than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Walter: &ldquo;I pray thee shame her not more than needs 
must be, lest, so doing, thou shame both me and thyself 
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bartholomew held his peace again for a while; then he said: 
&ldquo;Goeth she with child, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter reddened, and said: &ldquo;I wot not; nor of whom the 
child may be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they both sat silent, till 
Bartholomew spake, saying: &ldquo;The end of it is, son, that 
this is Monday, and that thou shalt go aboard in the small hours 
of Wednesday; and meanwhile I shall look to it that thou go not 
away empty-handed; the skipper of the Katherine is a good man and
true, and knows the seas well; and my servant Robert the Low, who
is clerk of the lading, is trustworthy and wise, and as myself in
all matters that look towards chaffer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Katherine 
is new and stout-builded, and should be lucky, whereas she is 
under the ward of her who is the saint called upon in the church 
where thou wert christened, and myself before thee; and thy 
mother, and my father and mother all lie under the chancel 
thereof, as thou wottest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith the elder rose up and went his ways about his 
business, and there was no more said betwixt him and his son on 
this matter.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II: GOLDEN WALTER TAKES SHIP TO SAIL THE SEAS</h2>
<p>When Walter went down to the Katherine next morning, there was
the skipper Geoffrey, who did him reverence, and made him all 
cheer, and showed him his room aboard ship, and the plenteous 
goods which his father had sent down to the quays already, such 
haste as he had made.&nbsp; Walter thanked his father&rsquo;s 
love in his heart, but otherwise took little heed to his affairs,
but wore away the time about the haven, gazing listlessly on the 
ships that were making them ready outward, or unlading, and the 
mariners and aliens coming and going: and all these were to him 
as the curious images woven on a tapestry.</p>
<p>At last when he had wellnigh come back again to the Katherine,
he saw there a tall ship, which he had scarce noted before, a 
ship all-boun, which had her boats out, and men sitting to the 
oars thereof ready to tow her outwards when the hawser should be 
cast off, and by seeming her mariners were but abiding for some 
one or other to come aboard.</p>
<p>So Walter stood idly watching the said ship, and as he looked,
lo! folk passing him toward the gangway.&nbsp; These were three; 
first came a dwarf, dark-brown of hue and hideous, with long arms
and ears exceeding great and dog-teeth that stuck out like the 
fangs of a wild beast.&nbsp; He was clad in a rich coat of yellow
silk, and bare in his hand a crooked bow, and was girt with a 
broad sax.</p>
<p>After him came a maiden, young by seeming, of scarce twenty 
summers; fair of face as a flower; grey-eyed, brown-haired, with 
lips full and red, slim and gentle of body.&nbsp; Simple was her 
array, of a short and strait green gown, so that on her right 
ankle was clear to see an iron ring.</p>
<p>Last of the three was a lady, tall and stately, so radiant of 
visage and glorious of raiment, that it were hard to say what 
like she was; for scarce might the eye gaze steady upon her 
exceeding beauty; yet must every son of Adam who found himself 
anigh her, lift up his eyes again after he had dropped them, and 
look again on her, and yet again and yet again.&nbsp; Even so did
Walter, and as the three passed by him, it seemed to him as if 
all the other folk there about had vanished and were nought; nor 
had he any vision before his eyes of any looking on them, save 
himself alone.&nbsp; They went over the gangway into the ship, 
and he saw them go along the deck till they came to the house on 
the poop, and entered it and were gone from his sight.</p>
<p>There he stood staring, till little by little the thronging 
people of the quays came into his eye-shot again; then he saw how
the hawser was cast off and the boats fell to tugging the big 
ship toward the harbour-mouth with hale and how of men.&nbsp; 
Then the sail fell down from the yard and was sheeted home and 
filled with the fair wind as the ship&rsquo;s bows ran up on the 
first green wave outside the haven.&nbsp; Even therewith the 
shipmen cast abroad a banner, whereon was done in a green field a
grim wolf ramping up against a maiden, and so went the ship upon 
her way.</p>
<p>Walter stood awhile staring at her empty place where the waves
ran into the haven-mouth, and then turned aside and toward the 
Katherine; and at first he was minded to go ask shipmaster 
Geoffrey of what he knew concerning the said ship and her alien 
wayfarers; but then it came into his mind, that all this was but 
an imagination or dream of the day, and that he were best to 
leave it untold to any.&nbsp; So therewith he went his way from 
the water-side, and through the streets unto his father&rsquo;s 
house; but when he was but a little way thence, and the door was 
before him, him-seemed for a moment of time that he beheld those 
three coming out down the steps of stone and into the street; to 
wit the dwarf, the maiden, and the stately lady: but when he 
stood still to abide their coming, and looked toward them, lo! 
there was nothing before him save the goodly house of Bartholomew
Golden, and three children and a cur dog playing about the steps 
thereof, and about him were four or five passers-by going about 
their business.&nbsp; Then was he all confused in his mind, and 
knew not what to make of it, whether those whom he had seemed to 
see pass aboard ship were but images of a dream, or children of 
Adam in very flesh.</p>
<p>Howsoever, he entered the house, and found his father in the 
chamber, and fell to speech with him about their matters; but for
all that he loved his father, and worshipped him as a wise and 
valiant man, yet at that hour he might not hearken the words of 
his mouth, so much was his mind entangled in the thought of those
three, and they were ever before his eyes, as if they had been 
painted on a table by the best of limners.&nbsp; And of the two 
women he thought exceeding much, and cast no wyte upon himself 
for running after the desire of strange women.&nbsp; For he said 
to himself that he desired not either of the twain; nay, he might
not tell which of the twain, the maiden or the stately queen, 
were clearest to his eyes; but sore he desired to see both of 
them again, and to know what they were.</p>
<p>So wore the hours till the Wednesday morning, and it was time 
that he should bid farewell to his father and get aboard ship; 
but his father led him down to the quays and on to the Katherine,
and there Walter embraced him, not without tears and forebodings;
for his heart was full.&nbsp; Then presently the old man went 
aland; the gangway was unshipped, the hawsers cast off; the oars 
of the towing-boats splashed in the dark water, the sail fell 
down from the yard, and was sheeted home, and out plunged the 
Katherine into the misty sea and rolled up the grey slopes, 
casting abroad her ancient withal, whereon was beaten the token 
of Bartholomew Golden, to wit a B and a G to the right and the 
left, and thereabove a cross and a triangle rising from the 
midst.</p>
<p>Walter stood on the stern and beheld, yet more with the mind 
of him than with his eyes; for it all seemed but the double of 
what the other ship had done; and the thought of it as if the 
twain were as beads strung on one string and led away by it into 
the same place, and thence to go in the like order, and so on 
again and again, and never to draw nigher to each other.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III: WALTER HEARETH TIDINGS OF THE DEATH OF HIS 
FATHER</h2>
<p>Fast sailed the Katherine over the seas, and nought befell to 
tell of, either to herself or her crew.&nbsp; She came to one 
cheaping-town and then to another, and so on to a third and a 
fourth; and at each was buying and selling after the manner of 
chapmen; and Walter not only looked on the doings of his 
father&rsquo;s folk, but lent a hand, what he might, to help them
in all matters, whether it were in seaman&rsquo;s craft, or in 
chaffer.&nbsp; And the further he went and the longer the time 
wore, the more he was eased of his old trouble wherein his wife 
and her treason had to do.</p>
<p>But as for the other trouble, to wit his desire and longing to
come up with those three, it yet flickered before him; and though
he had not seen them again as one sees people in the streets, and
as if he might touch them if he would, yet were their images 
often before his mind&rsquo;s eye; and yet, as time wore, not so 
often, nor so troublously; and forsooth both to those about him 
and to himself, he seemed as a man well healed of his melancholy 
mood.</p>
<p>Now they left that fourth stead, and sailed over the seas and 
came to a fifth, a very great and fair city, which they had made 
more than seven months from Langton on Holm; and by this time was
Walter taking heed and joyance in such things as were toward in 
that fair city, so far from his kindred, and especially he looked
on the fair women there, and desired them, and loved them; but 
lightly, as befalleth young men.</p>
<p>Now this was the last country whereto the Katherine was boun; 
so there they abode some ten months in daily chaffer, and in 
pleasuring them in beholding all that there was of rare and 
goodly, and making merry with the merchants and the towns-folk, 
and the country-folk beyond the gates, and Walter was grown as 
busy and gay as a strong young man is like to be, and was as one 
who would fain be of some account amongst his own folk.</p>
<p>But at the end of this while, it befell on a day, as he was 
leaving his hostel for his booth in the market, and had the door 
in his hand, there stood before him three mariners in the guise 
of his own country, and with them was one of clerkly aspect, whom
he knew at once for his father&rsquo;s scrivener, Arnold 
Penstrong by name; and when Walter saw him his heart failed him 
and he cried out: &ldquo;Arnold, what tidings?&nbsp; Is all well 
with the folk at Langton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Arnold: &ldquo;Evil tidings are come with me; matters are
ill with thy folk; for I may not hide that thy father, 
Bartholomew Golden, is dead, God rest his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that word it was to Walter as if all that trouble which but
now had sat so light upon him, was once again fresh and heavy, 
and that his past life of the last few months had never been; and
it was to him as if he saw his father lying dead on his bed, and 
heard the folk lamenting about the house.&nbsp; He held his peace
awhile, and then he said in a voice as of an angry man:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Arnold! and did he die in his bed, or how? for he
was neither old nor ailing when we parted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Arnold: &ldquo;Yea, in his bed he died: but first he was 
somewhat sword-bitten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, and how?&rdquo; quoth Walter.</p>
<p>Said Arnold: &ldquo;When thou wert gone, in a few days&rsquo; 
wearing, thy father sent thy wife out of his house back to her 
kindred of the Reddings with no honour, and yet with no such 
shame as might have been, without blame to us of those who knew 
the tale of thee and her; which, God-a-mercy, will be pretty much
the whole of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, the Reddings took it amiss, and would 
have a mote with us Goldings to talk of booting.&nbsp; By 
ill-luck we yea-said that for the saving of the city&rsquo;s 
peace.&nbsp; But what betid?&nbsp; We met in our Gild-hall, and 
there befell the talk between us; and in that talk certain words 
could not be hidden, though they were none too seemly nor too 
meek.&nbsp; And the said words once spoken drew forth the whetted
steel; and there then was the hewing and thrusting!&nbsp; Two of 
ours were slain outright on the floor, and four of theirs, and 
many were hurt on either side.&nbsp; Of these was thy father, for
as thou mayst well deem, he was nought backward in the fray; but 
despite his hurts, two in the side and one on the arm, he went 
home on his own feet, and we deemed that we had come to our 
above.&nbsp; But well-a-way! it was an evil victory, whereas in 
ten days he died of his hurts.&nbsp; God have his soul!&nbsp; But
now, my master, thou mayst well wot that I am not come to tell 
thee this only, but moreover to bear the word of the kindred, to 
wit that thou come back with me straightway in the swift cutter 
which hath borne me and the tidings; and thou mayst look to it, 
that though she be swift and light, she is a keel full 
weatherly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said Walter: &ldquo;This is a bidding of war.&nbsp; Come 
back will I, and the Reddings shall wot of my coming.&nbsp; Are 
ye all-boun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; said Arnold, &ldquo;we may up anchor this 
very day, or to-morrow morn at latest.&nbsp; But what aileth 
thee, master, that thou starest so wild over my shoulder?&nbsp; I
pray thee take it not so much to heart!&nbsp; Ever it is the wont
of fathers to depart this world before their sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Walter&rsquo;s visage from wrathful red had become pale, 
and he pointed up street, and cried out: &ldquo;Look! dost thou 
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what, master?&rdquo; quoth Arnold: &ldquo;what! 
here cometh an ape in gay raiment; belike the beast of some 
jongleur.&nbsp; Nay, by God&rsquo;s wounds! &rsquo;tis a man, 
though he be exceeding mis-shapen like a very devil.&nbsp; Yea 
and now there cometh a pretty maid going as if she were of his 
meney; and lo! here, a most goodly and noble lady!&nbsp; Yea, I 
see; and doubtless she owneth both the two, and is of the 
greatest of the folk of this fair city; for on the maiden&rsquo;s
ankle I saw an iron ring, which betokeneth thralldom amongst 
these aliens.&nbsp; But this is strange! for notest thou not how 
the folk in the street heed not this quaint show; nay not even 
the stately lady, though she be as lovely as a goddess of the 
gentiles, and beareth on her gems that would buy Langton twice 
over; surely they must be over-wont to strange and gallant 
sights.&nbsp; But now, master, but now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, what is it?&rdquo; said Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, master, they should not yet be gone out of 
eye-shot, yet gone they are.&nbsp; What is become of them, are 
they sunk into the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush, man!&rdquo; said Walter, looking not on Arnold, 
but still staring down the street; &ldquo;they have gone into 
some house while thine eyes were turned from them a 
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, master, nay,&rdquo; said Arnold, &ldquo;mine eyes 
were not off them one instant of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Walter, somewhat snappishly, 
&ldquo;they are gone now, and what have we to do to heed such 
toys, we with all this grief and strife on our hands?&nbsp; Now 
would I be alone to turn the matter of thine errand over in my 
mind.&nbsp; Meantime do thou tell the shipmaster Geoffrey and our
other folk of these tidings, and thereafter get thee all ready; 
and come hither to me before sunrise to-morrow, and I shall be 
ready for my part; and so sail we back to Langton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith he turned him back into the house, and the others 
went their ways; but Walter sat alone in his chamber a long 
while, and pondered these things in his mind.&nbsp; And whiles he
made up his mind that he would think no more of the vision of 
those three, but would fare back to Langton, and enter into the 
strife with the Reddings and quell them, or die else.&nbsp; But 
lo, when he was quite steady in this doom, and his heart was 
lightened thereby, he found that he thought no more of the 
Reddings and their strife, but as matters that were passed and 
done with, and that now he was thinking and devising if by any 
means he might find out in what land dwelt those three.&nbsp; And
then again he strove to put that from him, saying that what he 
had seen was but meet for one brainsick, and a dreamer of 
dreams.&nbsp; But furthermore he thought, Yea, and was Arnold, 
who this last time had seen the images of those three, a dreamer 
of waking dreams? for he was nought wonted in such wise; then 
thought he: At least I am well content that he spake to me of 
their likeness, not I to him; for so I may tell that there was at
least something before my eyes which grew not out of mine own 
brain.&nbsp; And yet again, why should I follow them; and what 
should I get by it; and indeed how shall I set about it?</p>
<p>Thus he turned the matter over and over; and at last, seeing 
that if he grew no foolisher over it, he grew no wiser, he became
weary thereof, and bestirred him, and saw to the trussing up of 
his goods, and made all ready for his departure, and so wore the 
day and slept at nightfall; and at daybreak comes Arnold to lead 
him to their keel, which hight the Bartholomew.&nbsp; He tarried 
nought, and with few farewells went aboard ship, and an hour 
after they were in the open sea with the ship&rsquo;s head turned
toward Langton on Holm.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV: STORM BEFALLS THE BARTHOLOMEW, AND SHE IS DRIVEN 
OFF HER COURSE</h2>
<p>Now swift sailed the Bartholomew for four weeks toward the 
north-west with a fair wind, and all was well with ship and 
crew.&nbsp; Then the wind died out on even of a day, so that the 
ship scarce made way at all, though she rolled in a great swell 
of the sea, so great, that it seemed to ridge all the main 
athwart.&nbsp; Moreover down in the west was a great bank of 
cloud huddled up in haze, whereas for twenty days past the sky 
had been clear, save for a few bright white clouds flying before 
the wind.&nbsp; Now the shipmaster, a man right cunning in his 
craft, looked long on sea and sky, and then turned and bade the 
mariners take in sail and be right heedful.&nbsp; And when Walter
asked him what he looked for, and wherefore he spake not to him 
thereof, he said surlily: &ldquo;Why should I tell thee what any 
fool can see without telling, to wit that there is weather to 
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they abode what should befall, and Walter went to his room 
to sleep away the uneasy while, for the night was now fallen; and
he knew no more till he was waked up by great hubbub and clamour 
of the shipmen, and the whipping of ropes, and thunder of 
flapping sails, and the tossing and weltering of the ship 
withal.&nbsp; But, being a very stout-hearted young man, he lay 
still in his room, partly because he was a landsman, and had no 
mind to tumble about amongst the shipmen and hinder them; and 
withal he said to himself: What matter whether I go down to the 
bottom of the sea, or come back to Langton, since either way my 
life or my death will take away from me the fulfilment of 
desire?&nbsp; Yet soothly if there hath been a shift of wind, 
that is not so ill; for then shall we be driven to other lands, 
and so at the least our home-coming shall be delayed, and other 
tidings may hap amidst of our tarrying.&nbsp; So let all be as it
will.</p>
<p>So in a little while, in spite of the ship&rsquo;s wallowing 
and the tumult of the wind and waves, he fell asleep again, and 
woke no more till it was full daylight, and there was the 
shipmaster standing in the door of his room, the sea-water all 
streaming from his wet-weather raiment.&nbsp; He said to Walter: 
&ldquo;Young master, the sele of the day to thee!&nbsp; For by 
good hap we have gotten into another day.&nbsp; Now I shall tell 
thee that we have striven to beat, so as not to be driven off our
course, but all would not avail, wherefore for these three hours 
we have been running before the wind; but, fair sir, so big hath 
been the sea that but for our ship being of the stoutest, and our
men all yare, we had all grown exceeding wise concerning the 
ground of the mid-main.&nbsp; Praise be to St. Nicholas and all 
Hallows! for though ye shall presently look upon a new sea, and 
maybe a new land to boot, yet is that better than looking on the 
ugly things down below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all well with ship and crew then?&rdquo; said 
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea forsooth,&rdquo; said the shipmaster; &ldquo;verily
the Bartholomew is the darling of Oak Woods; come up and look at 
it, how she is dealing with wind and waves all free from 
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Walter did on his foul-weather raiment, and went up on to 
the quarter-deck, and there indeed was a change of days; for the 
sea was dark and tumbling mountain-high, and the white-horses 
were running down the valleys thereof, and the clouds drave low 
over all, and bore a scud of rain along with them; and though 
there was but a rag of sail on her, the ship flew before the 
wind, rolling a great wash of water from bulwark to bulwark.</p>
<p>Walter stood looking on it all awhile, holding on by a 
stay-rope, and saying to himself that it was well that they were 
driving so fast toward new things.</p>
<p>Then the shipmaster came up to him and clapped him on the 
shoulder and said: &ldquo;Well, shipmate, cheer up! and now come 
below again and eat some meat, and drink a cup with 
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Walter went down and ate and drank, and his heart was 
lighter than it had been since he had heard of his father&rsquo;s
death, and the feud awaiting him at home, which forsooth he had 
deemed would stay his wanderings a weary while, and therewithal 
his hopes.&nbsp; But now it seemed as if he needs must wander, 
would he, would he not; and so it was that even this fed his 
hope; so sore his heart clung to that desire of his to seek home 
to those three that seemed to call him unto them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V: NOW THEY COME TO A NEW LAND</h2>
<p>Three days they drave before the wind, and on the fourth the 
clouds lifted, the sun shone out and the offing was clear; the 
wind had much abated, though it still blew a breeze, and was a 
head wind for sailing toward the country of Langton.&nbsp; So 
then the master said that, since they were bewildered, and the 
wind so ill to deal with, it were best to go still before the 
wind that they might make some land and get knowledge of their 
whereabouts from the folk thereof.&nbsp; Withal he said that he 
deemed the land not to be very far distant.</p>
<p>So did they, and sailed on pleasantly enough, for the weather 
kept on mending, and the wind fell till it was but a light 
breeze, yet still foul for Langton.</p>
<p>So wore three days, and on the eve of the third, the man from 
the topmast cried out that he saw land ahead; and so did they all
before the sun was quite set, though it were but a cloud no 
bigger than a man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>When night fell they struck not sail, but went forth toward 
the land fair and softly; for it was early summer, so that the 
nights were neither long nor dark.</p>
<p>But when it was broad daylight, they opened a land, a long 
shore of rocks and mountains, and nought else that they could see
at first.&nbsp; Nevertheless as day wore and they drew nigher, 
first they saw how the mountains fell away from the sea, and were
behind a long wall of sheer cliff; and coming nigher yet, they 
beheld a green plain going up after a little in green bents and 
slopes to the feet of the said cliff-wall.</p>
<p>No city nor haven did they see there, not even when they were 
far nigher to the land; nevertheless, whereas they hankered for 
the peace of the green earth after all the tossing and unrest of 
the sea, and whereas also they doubted not to find at the least 
good and fresh water, and belike other bait in the plain under 
the mountains, they still sailed on not unmerrily; so that by 
nightfall they cast anchor in five-fathom water hard by the 
shore.</p>
