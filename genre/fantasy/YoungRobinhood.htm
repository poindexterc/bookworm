<p id="id00013" style="margin-top: 4em">Sit still, will you?  I never saw such a boy: wriggling about like
a young eel."</p>

<p id="id00014">"I can't help it, David," said the little fellow so roughly spoken
to by a sour-looking serving man; "the horse does jog so, and it's
so slippery.  If I didn't keep moving I should go off."</p>

<p id="id00015">"You'll soon go off if you don't keep a little quieter," growled
the man angrily, "for I'll pitch you among the bushes."</p>

<p id="id00016">"No, you won't," said the boy laughing.  "You daren't do so."</p>

<p id="id00017">"What!  I'll let you see, young master.  I want to know why they
couldn't let you have a donkey or a mule, instead of hanging you on
behind me."</p>

<p id="id00018">"Aunt said I should be safer behind you," said the boy; "but I'm
not.  It's so hard to hold on by your belt, because you're so——"</p>

<p id="id00019">"Look here. Master Robin, I get enough o' that from the men.  If
you say I'm so fat, I'll pitch you into the first patch o' brambles
we come to."</p>

<p id="id00020">"But you are fat," said the boy; "and you dare not.  If you did my
father would punish you."</p>

<p id="id00021">"He wouldn't know."</p>

<p id="id00022">"Oh! yes he would, David," said the little fellow, confidently;
"the other men would tell him."</p>

<p id="id00023">"They wouldn't know," said the man with a chuckle.  "I say, aren't
you afraid?"</p>

<p id="id00024">"No," said the boy.  "What of, tumbling off?  I could jump."</p>

<p id="id00025">"'Fraid of going through this great dark forest?"</p>

<p id="id00026">"No.  What is there to be afraid of?"</p>

<p id="id00027">"Robbers and thieves, and all sorts of horrid things.  Why, we
might meet Robin Hood and his men."</p>

<p id="id00028">"I should like that," said the boy.</p>

<p id="id00029">"What?" cried the serving man, and he looked round at the great oak
and beech trees through which the faintly marked road lay, and then
forward and backward at the dozen mules, laden with packs of cloth,
every two of which were led by an armed man.  "You'd like that?"</p>

<p id="id00030">"Yes," said the boy.  "I want to see him."</p>

<p id="id00031">"Here's a pretty sort of a boy," said the man.  "Why, he'd eat you
like a radish."</p>

<p id="id00032">"No, he wouldn't," said the boy, "because I'm not a bit like a
radish; and I say, David, do turn your belt round."</p>

<p id="id00033">"Turn my belt round?" said the man, in astonishment.  "What for?"</p>

<p id="id00034">"So as to put the sword the other side. It does keep on banging my
legs so. They're quite bruised."</p>

<p id="id00035">"It's me that'll be bruised, with you punching and sticking your
fisties into my belt.  Put your legs on the other side.  I can't
move my sword.  I might want it to fight, you know."</p>

<p id="id00036">"Who with?" asked the boy.</p>

<p id="id00037">"Robbers after the bales o' cloth.  I shall be precious glad to get
'em safe to the town, and be back home again with whole bones.  Sit
still, will you!  Wriggling again!  How am I to get you safe home
to your father if you keep sidling off like that?  Want me to hand
you over to one of the men?"</p>

<p id="id00038">"Yes, please," said the boy, dolefully.</p>

<p id="id00039">"What?  Don't want to ride on one of the mules, do you?"</p>

<p id="id00040">"Yes, I do," said the boy.  "I should be more comfortable sitting
on one of the packs.  I'm sure aunt would have said I was to sit
there, if she had known."</p>

<p id="id00041">"Look here, young squire," said the man, sourly; "you've too much
tongue, and you know too much what aren't good for you.  Your aunt,
my old missus, says to me:</p>

<p id="id00042">"'David,' she says, 'you are to take young Master Robin behind you
on the horse, where he can hold on by your belt, and you'll never
lose sight of him till you give him into his father the Sheriff's
hands, along with the bales of cloth; and you can tell the Sheriff
he has been a very good boy during his visit'; and now I can't."</p>

<p id="id00043">"Why can't you?" said the boy, sharply.</p>

<p id="id00044">"'Cause you're doing nothing but squirming and working about behind
my saddle.  I shall never get you to the town, if you go on like
this."</p>

<p id="id00045">The boy puckered up his forehead, and was silent as he wondered
whether he could manage to sit still for the two hours which were
yet to elapse before they stopped for the night at a village on the
outskirts of Sherwood Forest, ready to go on again the next morning.</p>

<p id="id00046">"I liked stopping with aunt at Ellton," said the little fellow to
himself, sadly, "and I should like to go again; but I should like
to be fetched home next time, for old David is so cross every time
I move, and——"</p>

<p id="id00047">"Look here, young fellow," growled the man, half turning in his
saddle; "if you don't sit still I'll get one of the pack ropes and
tie you on, like a sack.  I never see such a fidgety young elver in
my——Oh, look at that!"</p>

<p id="id00048">The man gave a tug at his horse's rein; but it was not needed, for
the stout cob had cocked its ears forward and stopped short, just
as the mules in front whisked themselves round, and the men who
drove them began to huddle together in a group.</p>

<p id="id00049">For all at once the way was barred by about a dozen men in rough
weather-stained green jerkins, each with a long bow and a sheaf of
arrows at his back, and a long quarter-staff in his hand.</p>

<p id="id00050">David, confidential servant and head man to Aunt Hester, of the
cloth works at Ellton, looked sharply round at the half-dozen
heavily-laden mules behind him; and beyond them he saw another
dozen or so of men, and more were coming from among the trees to
right and left.</p>

<p id="id00051">"Hoi! all of you," cried David to his men.  "Swords out!  We must
fight for the mistress's cloth."</p>

<p id="id00052">As he spoke, he seized the hilt of his sword and began to tug at
it; but it would not leave its sheath, and all the while he was
kicking at his horse's ribs with his heels, with the result that
the stout cob gave a kick and a plunge, lowered its head, and
dashed off at a gallop, with David holding on to the pommel.</p>

<p id="id00053">Two of the men made a snatch at the reins, but they were too late,
and turned to the mule-drivers, who were following their leader's
example and trying to escape amongst the trees, leaving the mules
huddled together, squealing and kicking in their fright.</p>

<p id="id00054">Young Robin just saw two packages roll to the ground as the cob
dashed off; then he was holding on with all his might to old
David's belt as the cob galloped away with half-a-dozen of the
robbers trying to cut it off.</p>

<p id="id00055">[Illustration: The stout cob dashed of at a gallop, with David
holding on to the pommel.]</p>

<p id="id00056">Then the little fellow felt that he was being jerked and knocked
and bruised, as the horse tore along with David, head and neck
stretched out.  There was a rush under some low boughs, and another
rush over a patch of brambles and tall bracken; then the cob made a
bold dash at a dense mass of low growth, when there was a violent
jerk as he made a bound, followed by a feeling as if the boy's arms
were being torn out at the shoulders, a rush through the air, a
heavy blow, and a sensation of tearing, and all was, giddiness and
pain.</p>

<h2 id="id00057" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p id="id00058">It is not nice to be pitched by a man off a horse's back on to the
top of your head.</p>

<p id="id00059">That is what young Robin thought as he sat up and rubbed the place,
looking very rueful and sad.</p>

<p id="id00060">But he did not seem to be entirely alone there in the dense forest,
for there was another young robin, with large eyes and a speckled
jacket, sitting upon a twig and watching him intently.  Robin could
think of nothing but himself, his aching head, and his scratches,
some of which were bleeding.</p>

<p id="id00061">Then he listened, and fancied that he heard shouting, with the
trampling of mules and the breaking of twigs.</p>

<p id="id00062">But he was giddy and puzzled, and after struggling through some
undergrowth he sat down upon what looked like a green velvet
cushion; but it was only the moss-covered root of a great beech
tree, which covered him like a roof and made all soft and shady.</p>

<p id="id00063">And now it was perfectly quiet, and it seemed restful after being
shaken and jerked about on the horse's back.  Robin was tired too,
and the dull, half-stupefied state of his brain stopped him from
being startled by his strange position.  His head ached though, and
it seemed nice to rest it, and he stretched himself out on the moss
and looked up through the leaves of the great tree, where he could
see in one place the ruddy rays of the evening sun glowing, and
then he could see nothing—think nothing.</p>

<p id="id00064">Then he could think, though he still could not see, for it was very
dark and silent and strange, and for some minutes he could not
understand why he was out there on the moss instead of being in
Aunt Hester's house at Elton, or at home in Nottingham town.</p>

<p id="id00065">But he understood it all at once, recollecting what had taken
place, and for a time he felt very, very miserable.  It was
startling, too, when from close at hand someone seemed to begin
questioning him strangely by calling out:</p>

<p id="id00066">"Whoo-who-who-who?"</p>

<p id="id00067">But at the end of a minute or two he knew it was an owl, and soon
after he was fast asleep and did not think again till the sun was
shining brightly, and he sat up waiting for old David to come and
pull him up on the horse again.</p>

<p id="id00068">Robin waited, for he was afraid to move.</p>

<p id="id00069">"If I begin to wander about," he said to himself, "David will not
find me, and he will go home and tell father I'm lost, when all the
time he threw me off the horse because he was afraid and wanted to
save himself."</p>

<p id="id00070">So the boy sat still, waiting to be fetched.  The robin came and
looked at him again, as if wondering that he did not pull up
flowers by the roots and dig, so that worms and grubs might be
found, and finally flitted away.</p>

<p id="id00071">Then all at once there was the pattering of feet, and half-a-dozen
deer came into sight, with soft dappled coats, and one of them with
large flat pointed horns; but at the first movement Robin made they
dashed off among the trees in a series of bounds.</p>

<p id="id00072">Then there was another long pause, and Robin was thinking how
hungry he was, when something dropped close to him with a loud rap,
and looking up sharply, he caught sight of a little keen-eyed
bushy-tailed animal, looking down from a great branch as if in
search of something it had let fall.</p>

<p id="id00073">"Squirrel!" said Robin aloud, and the animal heard and saw him at
the same moment, showing its annoyance at the presence of an
intruder directly.  For it began to switch its tail and scold after
its fashion, loudly, its utterances seeming like a repetition of
the word "chop" more or less quickly made.</p>

<p id="id00074">Finding its scolding to be in vain, and that the boy would not go,
the squirrel did the next best thing—bounded along from bough to
bough; while, after waiting wearily in the hope of seeing David,
the boy began to look round this tree and the next, and finally
made his way some little distance farther into the forest, to be
startled at last by a harsh cry which was answered from first one
place and then another by the noisy party of jays that had been
disturbed in their happy solitude.</p>

<p id="id00075">To Robin it was just as if the first one had cried "Hoi! I say,
here's a boy."  And weary with waiting, and hungry as he was, the
constant harsh shouting irritated the little fellow so that he
hurried away followed by quite a burst of what seemed to be mocking
cries, with the intention of finding the track leading across the
forest; but he had not gone far before he found himself in an open
glade, dotted with beautiful great oak trees, and nearly covered
with the broad leaves of the bracken, which were agitated by
something passing through and beneath, giving forth a grunting
sound.  Directly after he caught sight of a long black back, then
of others, and he saw that he was close to a drove of small black
pigs, hunting for acorns.  One of the pigs found him at the same
moment and saluted him with a sharp, barking sound wonderfully like
that of a dog.</p>

<p id="id00076">This was taken up directly by the other members of the drove, who
with a great deal of barking and grunting came on to the attack,
for they did not confine themselves to threatening, their life in
the forest making them fierce enough to be dangerous.</p>

<p id="id00077">Robin's first thought was to run away, but he knew that four legs
are better than two for getting over the ground, and felt that the
drove would attack him more fiercely if they saw that he was afraid.</p>

<p id="id00078">His next idea was to climb 'up into the fork of one of the big
trees, but he knew that there was not time.  So he obeyed his third
notion, which was to jump to where a big piece of dead wood lay,
pick it up, and hit the foremost pig across the nose with it.</p>

<p id="id00079">That blow did wonders; it made the black pig which received it
utter a dismal squeal, and its companions stop and stand barking
and snapping all around him.  But the blow broke the piece of dead
wood in two, and the fierce little animals were coming on again,
when a voice cried:</p>

<p id="id00080">"Hi! you! knocking our tigs about!"  And a rough boy about a couple
of years older than Robin rushed into the middle of the herd,
kicking first at one and then at another, banging them with a long
hooked stick he held, and making them run squealing in all
directions.  "What are you knocking our tigs about for?" cried the
boy sharply, as he stared hard at the strange visitor to the
forest, his eyes looking greedily at the little fellow's purple and
white jerkin and his cap with a little white feather in it.</p>

<p id="id00081">"They were coming to bite me," said Robin quickly, while it struck
him as funny that the boy should knock the pigs about himself.</p>

<p id="id00082">"What are you doing here?" said the boy.</p>

<p id="id00083">Robin told of his misfortune, and finished by saying:</p>

<p id="id00084">"I'm so hungry, and I want to go home.  Where can I get some
breakfast?"</p>

<p id="id00085">"Dunno," said the boy.  "Have some of these?"</p>

<p id="id00086">He took a handful of acorns from a dirty satchel, and held them
out, Robin catching at them eagerly, putting one between his white
teeth, and biting it, but only to make a face full of disgust.</p>

<p id="id00087">"It's bitter," he said.  "It's not good to eat."</p>

<p id="id00088">"Makes our tigs fat," said the boy; "look at 'em."</p>

<p id="id00089">"But I'm not a pig," said Robin.  "I want some bread and milk.<br/>

Where can I get some?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00090">The boy shook his head.</p>

<p id="id00091">"Where do you live?" asked Robin.</p>

<p id="id00092">"Along o' master."</p>

<p id="id00093">"Where's that?"</p>

<p id="id00094">The boy shook his head and stared at the cap and feather, one of
his hands opening and shutting.</p>

<p id="id00095">"Will you show me the way home, then?"</p>

<p id="id00096">The boy shook his head again, and now stared at the velvet jerkin,
then at his own garb, which consisted of a piece of sack with slits
in it for his head and arms to come through, and a strip of
cow-skin for a belt to hold it in.</p>

<p id="id00097">"I could show you where to get something," he said at last.</p>

<p id="id00098">"Well, show me," cried Robin.</p>

<p id="id00099">"You give me that jacket and cap, then," cried the boy, in a husky,
low voice.</p>

<p id="id00100">"Give you my clothes?" said Robin, wonderingly.  "I can't do that."</p>

<p id="id00101">"Then I shall take 'em?" said the boy, in a husky growl.</p>

<p id="id00102">"I'm so hungry," cried Robin.  "Show me where to get something, and<br/>

I'll give you my cap and feather."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00103">"I wants the jacket too," said the boy.</p>

<p id="id00104">"I tell you I can't give you that," cried Robin.</p>

<p id="id00105">"Then I means to take it."</p>

<p id="id00106">Robin shrank away, and the boy turned upon him fiercely.</p>

<p id="id00107">"None of that," he cried.  "See this here stick?  If you was to try
to run away I should send it spinning after you, and it would break
your legs and knock you down, and I could send the tigs after you,
and they'd soon bring you back."</p>

<p id="id00108">Robin drew a deep breath; he felt hot, and his hands clenched as he
longed to strike out at his tyrant.  But the young swineherd was
big and strong, and the little fellow knew that he could do next to
nothing against such an enemy.</p>

<p id="id00109">Then there was a pause.  Robin stood, hot, excited, and panting;
the herd-boy threw himself down on his chest, rested his chin upon
his hands, as he stared fiercely at Robin, and kicked his feet up
and down; while the pigs roamed here and there, nuzzling the fallen
acorns out from the bracken, and crunching them up loudly.</p>

<p id="id00110">Robin wanted to run, and he did not want to run, and all at the
same time, for his strongest desire just then was to fight his
tyrant; and for some minutes neither spoke.</p>

<p id="id00111">At last the big boy said, in a low, growling way:</p>

<p id="id00112">"Now then, are you going to give me them things?"</p>

<p id="id00113">"No," said Robin, through his set teeth; and again there was
silence.</p>

<p id="id00114">"You give 'em to me, and I'll show you the way to where they live
and they'll give you roast deer and roast pig p'raps, for two of
ourn's gone.  Master says he counted 'em, and they aren't all
there, and he wales me with a strap because I let them take the
pigs, and next time he counts 'em there's more than there was
before, but he's whipped me all the same.  You give me them things,
and I'll take you where you'll get lots to eat, and milk and eggs
and apples.  D'yer hear?"</p>

<p id="id00115">"I won't give them to you.  I can't—I mustn't," cried Robin
passionately.</p>

<p id="id00116">The boy said nothing, but looked away at his pigs, two of which
were fighting.</p>

<p id="id00117">"Ah, would you?" he cried; and he made believe to rush at them with
his big hook-handled stick.</p>

<p id="id00118">Robin was thrown off his guard, and before he was aware of it the
boy made a side leap and, dropping his stick, seized him, threw him
over on his back, and sat astride upon his chest.</p>

<p id="id00119">"Now won't you give em to me?" cried the herd-boy; and he whipped
off the cap and threw it to a little distance, with the result that
half a dozen pigs rushed at it; and as he made a brave fight to get
rid of his enemy, the last that Robin saw of his velvet cap and
plume was that one black pig tore out the feather, while another
was champing the velvet in his mouth.</p>

<p id="id00120">It was a brave fight, but all in vain, and a few minutes later the
boy was standing triumphantly over poor Robin, with the gay jerkin
rolled up under his arm; and the little fellow struggled to his
feet in his trunk hose and white linen shirt, hot, angry, and torn,
and wishing with all his might that he were as big and strong as
the tyrant who had mastered him.</p>

<p id="id00121">"I told yer I would," said the young ruffian, with a grin.  "You
should ha' given 'em to me at first, and then I shouldn't have hurt
yer.  Come on; I'll show yer now where yer can get something to
eat."</p>

<p id="id00122">In his anger and shame Robin felt that he wanted no food now, only
to go and hide himself away among the trees; but his enemy's next
words had their effect.</p>

<p id="id00123">"You didn't want this here," he said.  "You've got plenty on you
now.  Better nor I have.  There, go straight on there, and I'll
show yer.  D'yer hear?"</p>

<p id="id00124">"I don't want to go now," said Robin fiercely.</p>

<p id="id00125">"Oh, don't yer?  Then I do.  You're agoing afore I makes yer, and
when they've give yer a lot, you're going to eat part and bring
some to me so's I can help eat the rest.  You bring a lot, mind,
'cause I can eat ever so much.  Now then, go on."</p>

<p id="id00126">"I can't—I don't want to," cried Robin.  "You go first."</p>

<p id="id00127">"What, and master come, p'raps, and find me gone!  Likely! he'd
give me the strap again. There, get on."</p>

<p id="id00128">Robin winced, for the young ruffian picked up his stick and poked
him as he would one of his pigs.  But the little fellow could not
help himself, and he went on in the required direction among the
trees, the forest growing darker and darker, till suddenly voices
were heard, and the boy stopped,</p>

<p id="id00129">"You go straight along there," he said, "and I'll wait."</p>

<p id="id00130">"No, you go," said Robin.  "You know them."</p>

<p id="id00131">"Oh! yes, and them want some more pigs!  Want me to be leathered
again?"</p>

<p id="id00132">Robin said "No," but he felt all the time that he should like to
see the young tyrant flogged and forced to return the folded up
doublet; and he thought sadly of his spoiled and lost cap.</p>

<h2 id="id00133" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p id="id00134">"Now then, don't you be long," cried the young swineherd, and he
raised his stick threateningly, and made another thrust at Robin,
which was avoided; and feeling desperate now as well as hungry,
feeling too, that it would be better to fall into any other hands,
the little fellow ran on, following a faint track in and out among
the trees, till he came suddenly into an opening, face to face with
a group of fifty or sixty people busily engaged around a heap
beneath a spreading beech tree.</p>

<p id="id00135">Robin's first act was to stand and stare, for the heap consisted of
bales similar to those with which he had seen the mules laden a
couple of days back, and tied up together a few yards away were the
very mules, while the little crowd of men who were busy bore a very
strong resemblance to those by whom the attack was made on the
previous day.</p>

<p id="id00136">Robin knew nothing in those days about the old proverb of jumping
out of the frying-pan into the fire, but he felt something of the
kind as he found himself face to face with the marauders who had
seized upon the bales of cloth and put his aunt's servants to
flight, and without a moment's hesitation he turned and began to
hurry back, but ran into the arms of a huge fellow who caught him
up as if he had been a baby.</p>

<p id="id00137">[Illustration: Robin ran into the arms of a huge fellow, who caught
him up as if he had been a baby.]</p>

<p id="id00138">"Hullo, giant!" cried the big man, "who are you?"  And the party of
men with him, armed with long bows and arrows, began to laugh
merrily.</p>

<p id="id00139">"Let me go—let me go!" cried the boy, struggling angrily.</p>

<p id="id00140">"Steady, steady, my little Cock Robin," said the man, in his big
bluff way; "don't fight, or you'll ruffle your feathers."</p>

<p id="id00141">The boy ceased struggling directly.</p>

<p id="id00142">"How did you know my name was Robin?" he said.</p>

<p id="id00143">"Guessed it, little one.  There, I shan't hurt you.  Where do you
come from?"</p>

<p id="id00144">"Ellton," said the boy.</p>

<p id="id00145">"But what are you doing here in the forest?"</p>

<p id="id00146">"You came and fought David, and frightened him and the men away,
and those are our mules and the cloth."</p>

<p id="id00147">Robin stopped short, for the big man broke out into a loud whistle,
and then laughed.</p>

<p id="id00148">"Oh, that's it, is it?" he said; "and so your name's Robin, is it?"</p>

<p id="id00149">The little fellow nodded.  "Yes," he said.  "What's yours?"</p>

<p id="id00150">"John," said the great fellow, laughing heartily; "and they call me
little because I'm so big.  What do you think of that?"</p>

<p id="id00151">"I think it's very stupid," said the boy.  "I thought you must be<br/>

Robin Hood."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00152">"Then you thought wrong. But if you thought that this one was you
would be right.  Here he comes."  The boy looked in wonder at a
tall man who looked short beside Little John, as he came up in coat
of green with brown belt, a sword by his side, quiver of arrows
hung on his back, and longbow in his hand.</p>

<p id="id00153">"What woodland bird have you got here, John?" he said.  And the boy
saw that he smiled pleasantly and did not look fierce or
threatening.</p>

<p id="id00154">"A young Robin," said the big fellow; "part of yesterday's plunder."</p>

<p id="id00155">"I want to find my way home," said the boy.  "Will you please show
me?"</p>

<p id="id00156">"But you did not come here into the forest in shirt and hose, did
you, my little man?" said the great outlaw.</p>

<p id="id00157">"No; someone took my cap and doublet away, sir."</p>

<p id="id00158">Robin Hood frowned.</p>

<p id="id00159">"Who was it?" he cried angrily.  "Find out, John, and he shall have
a bowstring about his back.  Point out the man who stripped you, my
little lad," he continued, turning to the boy.</p>

<p id="id00160">"It wasn't a man," said the little fellow, "but a boy who minds
pigs."</p>

<p id="id00161">"What, a young swineherd!" cried the outlaw, laughing.  "Why did
you let him?  Why didn't you fight for your clothes like a man?"</p>

<p id="id00162">"I did," said young Robin stoutly; "but he was so big, he knocked
me down and sat upon me."</p>

<p id="id00163">"Oh! that makes all the difference.  How big was he—big as this
man?"</p>

<p id="id00164">Young Robin glanced at the giant who had caught him, and shook his
head.</p>

<p id="id00165">"No," he said; "not half, so big as he is.  But he was stronger
than I am."</p>

<p id="id00166">"So I suppose. Well, bring him along. Little John, and let's see if
the women can find him some clothes and a cap.  You would like
something more to wear, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p id="id00167">"I should like something to eat,"' said the boy sadly.  "I have not
had anything since breakfast."</p>

<p id="id00168">"That's not so very long," said Robin Hood. "We have not had
anything since breakfast."</p>

<p id="id00169">"But I mean since breakfast yesterday," said young Robin piteously.</p>

<p id="id00170">"What!" cried Little John. "Why, the poor boy's starved.  But we
can soon mend that.  Come here!"</p>

<p id="id00171">Young Robin's first movement was to shrink from the big fellow, but
he smiled down in such a bluff, amiable way, that the boy gave him
his hands, and in an instant he was swung up and sitting six feet
in the air upon the great fellow's shoulder, and then rode off to
an open-fronted shed-like place thatched with reeds, Robin Hood,
with his bow over his shoulder, walking by the side.</p>

<p id="id00172">"Here, Marian," cried the outlaw, and young Robin's heart gave a
throb and he made a movement to get down to go to the sweet-faced
woman who came hurriedly out, wide-eyed and wondering, in her green
kirtle, her long soft naturally curling hair rippling down her
back, but confined round her brow by a plain silver band in which a
few woodland flowers were placed.</p>

<p id="id00173">"Oh! Robin," she cried, flushing with pleasure; "who is this?"</p>

<p id="id00174">"It is some one for you to take care of," said the outlaw, who
smiled at the bright look in the girl's face.  "He is both hungry
and tired, and his people ran away and left him alone in the
forest."</p>

<p id="id00175">"Oh, my dear!" she cried, as Little John lightly jumped the boy
down at her feet.  "Come along."</p>

<p id="id00176">Young Robin put his hand in hers and gave her a look full of trust
and confidence, before turning to the two men, for all his troubles
seemed over now.</p>

<p id="id00177">"Thank you for bringing me here," he said; "but are you bold Robin<br/>

Hood and Little John, of whom I've heard my father talk?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00178">"I daresay we are the men he has talked about," said the outlaw
smiling; "but who is your father, and what did he say?"</p>

<p id="id00179">"My father is the Sheriff of Nottingham," said the boy, "and he
said that he was going to catch you and your men some day, for you
were very wicked and bad.  But he did not know how good and kind
you are, and I shall tell him when you send me home."</p>

<p id="id00180">The two men exchanged glances with Maid Marian.</p>

<p id="id00181">"We shall see," said the outlaw; "but you are nearly starved,
aren't you?"</p>

<p id="id00182">"Yes, very, very hungry," said the boy, looking piteously at his
new protector, whose hand he held.</p>

<p id="id00183">"Hungry?" she cried.</p>

<p id="id00184">"Yes, he has had nothing since yesterday morning; but you can cure
that."</p>

<p id="id00185">"Oh, my dear, my dear!" cried the woman.  And she hurried young
Robin beneath the shelter, and in a very short time he was smiling
up in her face in his thankfulness, for she had placed before him a
bowl of sweet new milk and some of the nicest bread he had ever
tasted.</p>

<p id="id00186">As he ate hungrily he had to answer Maid Marian's questions about
who he was and how he came there, which he did readily, and it did
not strike him as being very dreadful that the mules and their
loads had been seized, for old David had been very cross and severe
with him for getting tired, and these people in the forest were
most kind.</p>

<h2 id="id00187" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p id="id00188">It was a very strange life for a boy who had been accustomed to
every comfort, but young Robin enjoyed it, for everything seemed to
be so new and fresh, and the men treated him as if he had come to
them for the purpose of being made into a pet.</p>

<p id="id00189">They were, of course, fierce outlaws and robbers, ready to turn
their bows and swords against anyone; but the poor people who lived
in and about the forest liked and helped them, for Robin Hood's men
never did them harm, while as to young Robin, they were all eager
to take him out with them and show him the wonders of the forest.</p>

<p id="id00190">On the second day after his arrival in the camp, the boy asked when
he was to be shown the way home, and he asked again on the third
day, but only to be told each time that he should go soon.</p>

<p id="id00191">On the fourth day he forgot to ask, for he was busy with big Little
John, who smiled with satisfaction when young Robin chose to stay
with him instead of going with some of the men into the forest
after a deer.</p>

<p id="id00192">Young Robin forgot to ask when he was to be shown the way home,
because Little John had promised to make him a bow and arrows and
to teach him how to use them.  The great tall outlaw kept his word
too, and long before evening he hung a cap upon a broken bough of
an oak tree and set young Robin to work about twenty yards away
shooting arrows at the mark.</p>

<p id="id00193">"You've got to hit that every time you shoot," said Little John;
"and when you can do that at twenty yards you have got to do it at
forty.  Now begin."</p>

<p id="id00194">For the bow was ready and made of a piece of yew, and half a dozen
arrows had been finished.</p>

<p id="id00195">"Think you can hit it?" said Little John, after showing the boy how
to string his bow and fit the notch of the arrow to the string.</p>

<p id="id00196">"Oh! yes," said Robin confidently.</p>

<p id="id00197">"That's right! then you will soon be able to kill a deer."</p>

<p id="id00198">"But I don't want to kill a deer," said the boy.  "I want to see
some, but I shouldn't like to kill one."</p>

<p id="id00199">"Wait till you're hungry, my fine fellow," said Little John,
laughing.  "But my word! you look fine this morning; just like one
of us.  Did Maid Marian make you that green jerkin?"</p>

<p id="id00200">"Yes," said the boy.</p>

<p id="id00201">"That's right; so's your cap and feather.  But now then, try if you
can hit the cap.  Draw the arrow right to the head before you let
it go.  My word, what funny little fumbling fingers yours are!"</p>

<p id="id00202">"Are they?" cried Robin, who thought that his teacher's hands were
the biggest he had ever seen.</p>

<p id="id00203">"Like babies' fingers," said Little John, smiling down at the boy
as if very much amused.  "Now then, draw right to the head."</p>

<p id="id00204">"I can't," said the boy; "it's so hard."</p>

<p id="id00205">"That's because you are not used to it, little one.  Try again.
Hold tight, and pull hard.  Steadily.  That's the way.  Now loose
it and let it go."</p>

<p id="id00206">Young Robin did as he was told, and away went the arrow down
between the trees, to fall with its feathered wings just showing
above the fallen leaves.</p>

<p id="id00207">"That didn't hit the cap," said Little John.  "Never went near."</p>

<p id="id00208">Young Robin shook his head.</p>

<p id="id00209">"Did you look at the cap when you loosed the arrow?"</p>

<p id="id00210">"No," said Robin; "I shut my eyes."</p>

<p id="id00211">"Try again then, and keep them open."</p>

<p id="id00212">Robin tried and tried again till he had sent off all six of his
shafts, and then he stood and looked up at Little John, and Little
John looked down at him.</p>

<p id="id00213">"You couldn't kill a deer for dinner to-day," said the big fellow.</p>

<p id="id00214">"No," said young Robin; "it's so hard.  Could you have hit it?"</p>

<p id="id00215">"I think I could if I stood ten times as far away," said the great
fellow quietly.</p>

<p id="id00216">"Oh, do try, please," cried Robin.</p>

<p id="id00217">"Very well; only let's pick up your arrows first, or we may lose
some of them.  Always pick up your arrows while they are fresh—I
mean, while you can remember where they are."</p>

<p id="id00218">The shafts were picked up, mostly by Little John, whose eyes were
very sharp at seeing where the little arrows lay; and then they
walked back, and Robin had to run by his big companion's side, for
he began to stride away, counting as he went, till he had taken two
hundred steps from the tree all along one of the alleys of the
forest, when he stopped short.</p>

<p id="id00219">"Now then, my little bowman," he said; "think I can hit the mark
now?"</p>

<p id="id00220">"No," said Robin decisively; "we're too far away.  I can hardly see
the cap."</p>

<p id="id00221">"Well, let's try," said Little John, stringing his bow, and then
carefully selecting an arrow from the quiver at his back.  This
arrow he drew two or three times through his hand so as to smooth
the feathering and make the web lie straight, before fitting the
notch to the string.</p>

<p id="id00222">"So you think it's too far?" said Little John.</p>

<p id="id00223">"Yes, ever so much."</p>

<p id="id00224">"Ah, well, we'll try," said the big fellow coolly.  "Where-about
shall I hit the cap—in the middle?"</p>

<p id="id00225">[Illustration: "Ah, well, we'll try," said Little John.<br/>

"Whereabouts shall I hit the cap?"]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00226">"No," said Robin; "just at the top of the brim."</p>

<p id="id00227">"Very well," said the big fellow, standing up very straight and
rather sidewise, as he held his bow at his left arm's length,
slowly drew the arrow to the head, and then as Robin gazed in the
direction of the indistinctly seen hat hanging on the tree-trunk—</p>

<p id="id00228">Twang!</p>

<p id="id00229">The arrow had been loosed, and the bow had given forth a strange
deep musical sound.</p>

<p id="id00230">Robin looked sharply at Little John, and the big outlaw looked down
at him.</p>

<p id="id00231">"Where did that arrow go?" said the boy.</p>

<p id="id00232">"Let's see," said Little John.</p>

<p id="id00233">"I don't think we shall ever find it again," continued Robin.</p>

<p id="id00234">They walked back, the outlaw very slowly, and Robin quite fast so
as to keep up with him.</p>

<p id="id00235">"Perhaps not," said Little John, "but I don't often lose my arrows."</p>

<p id="id00236">"This one has gone right through the ferns," thought Robin, and he
felt glad with the thought of the big fellow having missed the
mark, but as they walked nearer, he kept his eyes fixed upon the
great trunk dimly seen in the shade, being tripped up twice by the
bracken fronds; but he saved himself from a fall and watched the
tree trunk still, while the hat hanging on the old bough grew
plainer, just as it had been before.</p>

<p id="id00237">They had walked back nearly three parts of the way when Robin
suddenly saw something which made him start, for there was a tiny
bit of something white above something dark, and those marks were
not on the brim of the hat before.</p>

<p id="id00238">The next minute Robin's eyes began to open wider, for he knew that
he was looking at the feathered end of the arrow, pointing straight
at him; and directly after, as he stepped a little on one side to
avoid an ant-hill, he could see the whole of the arrow except the
point, which had passed through the brim of the hat.</p>

<p id="id00239">"Why, you hit it!" he cried excitedly.</p>

<p id="id00240">"Well, that's what I tried to do," said Little John.</p>

<p id="id00241">"But you hit it just in the place I said."</p>

<p id="id00242">"Yes, you told me to," said Little John, smiling.  "That's how you
must learn to shoot when you grow up to be a man."</p>

<p id="id00243">Young Robin said nothing, but stood rubbing one ear very gently,
and staring at the hat.</p>

<p id="id00244">"Well," said Little John, smiling down at his companion, "what are
you thinking about?"</p>

<p id="id00245">"I was thinking that it is very wonderful for you to stand so far
off and shoot like that."</p>

<p id="id00246">"Were you, now?" said Little John.  "Well, it is not wonderful at
all.  If you keep on trying for years you will be able to do it
quite as well.  I'll teach you.  Shall I?"</p>

<p id="id00247">"I should like you to," said Robin, shaking his head; "but I can't
stop here.  I must go home to my father."</p>

<p id="id00248">"Oh! must you?" said Little John.  "Go home to your father and
mother, eh?"</p>

<p id="id00249">Robin shook his head.</p>

<p id="id00250">"No," he said; "my mother's dead, and I live sometimes with father
and sometimes with aunt.  I am going home to father now, as soon as
you show me the way.  When are you going to show me?"</p>

<p id="id00251">Little John screwed up his face till it was full of wrinkles.<br/>

"Ah," he said, "I don't know.  You must ask the captain."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00252">"Who is the captain?" said the boy.</p>

<p id="id00253">"Eh?  Why, Robin Hood, of course.  But I wouldn't ask him just yet."</p>

<p id="id00254">"Why not?"</p>

<p id="id00255">"Eh?  Why not?  Because it might be awkward.  You see, it's a long
way, and you couldn't go by yourself."</p>

<p id="id00256">"Well, you could show me," said young Robin.  "You would, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p id="id00257">"I would if I could," said Little John; "but I'm afraid I couldn't."</p>

<p id="id00258">"Oh! you could, I'm sure," said young Robin.  "You're so big."</p>

<p id="id00259">"Oh! yes, I'm big enough," said Little John, laughing; "but if I
were to take you home your father would not let me come back again;
and besides, the captain would not let me go for fear that I should
be killed."</p>

<p id="id00260">"Killed?" said the boy, staring at his big companion.</p>

<p id="id00261">"Why, who would kill you?"</p>

<p id="id00262">"Your father, perhaps."</p>

<p id="id00263">"What, for being kind to me?"</p>

<p id="id00264">"I can't explain all these things to you, mite.  Here's someone
coming.  Let's ask him.  Hi!  Captain!  Young squire wants me to
take him home."</p>

<p id="id00265">Robin Hood, who had just caught sight of the pair and come up,
smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p id="id00266">"Not yet, little one," he said.  "I can't spare big Little John.<br/>

Why, aren't you happy here in the merry greenwood under the trees?<br/>

I thought you liked us."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00267">"So I do," said young Robin, "and I should like to stay ever so
long and watch the deer and the birds, and learn to shoot with my
bow and arrows."</p>

<p id="id00268">"That's right.  Well said, little one," cried Robin Hood, patting
the boy on the head.</p>

<p id="id00269">"But I'm afraid that my father will be very cross if I don't try to
go home."</p>

<p id="id00270">"Then try and make yourself happy, my boy," said Robin Hood, "for
you have tried hard to go home, and you cannot go."</p>

<p id="id00271">"Why?" said young Robin.</p>

<p id="id00272">"For a dozen reasons," said the outlaw, smiling.  "Here are some:
you could not find your way; you would starve to death in the
forest; you might meet people who would behave worse to you than
the young swineherd, or encounter wild beasts; then, biggest reason
of all: I will not let you go."</p>

<p id="id00273">Young Robin was silent for a moment or two, and then he said
quickly:</p>

<p id="id00274">"You might tell Little John to take me home.  My father would be so
glad to see him."</p>

<p id="id00275">Robin Hood and the big fellow just named looked at one another and
laughed.</p>

<p id="id00276">"Yes," said Robin Hood, patting the boy on the shoulder, "now
that's just it.  Your father, the Sheriff, would be so glad to see
Little John that he would keep him altogether; and I can't spare
him."</p>

<p id="id00277">"I don't think my father would be so unkind," said Robin.</p>

<p id="id00278">"But I am sure he would, little man," said the outlaw.  "He'd be so
glad to get him that he would spoil him.  Eh, John?  What do you
think?"</p>

<p id="id00279">"Ay, that he would," said Little John, shaking his head.  "He'd be
sure to spoil me.  He'd cut me shorter, perhaps, or else hang me up
for an ornament.  No, my little man, I couldn't take you home."</p>

<p id="id00280">"There," said the outlaw, smiling; "you must wait, my boy. Try and
be contented as you are.  Maid Marian's very kind to you, is she
not?"</p>

<p id="id00281">"Oh! yes," cried the boy, with his face lighting up, "and that's
why I don't want to go."</p>

<p id="id00282">"Hullo!" growled Little John.  "Why, you said just now that you did
want to go!" "Did I?" said the boy thoughtfully.</p>

<p id="id00283">"To be sure you did.  What do you mean."</p>

<p id="id00284">"I mean," said the boy, looking wistfully from one to the other,
"that I feel as if I ought to go home, but I think I should like to
stay."</p>

<p id="id00285">"Hurrah!" cried Little John, taking off and waving his hat.  "Hear
that, captain?  You've got another to add to your merry men.  Young
Robin and I make a capital pair.  Come along, youngster, and let's
practise shooting at the mark, and then we'll make enough arrows to
fill your quiver."</p>

<p id="id00286">Five minutes later young Robin was standing as he had been placed
by his big companion, who sat down and watched him while he
sturdily drew the notch of his arrow right to his ear, and then
loosed the whizzing shaft to go flying away through the woodland
shade, while Little John shouted as gleefully as some big boy.</p>

<p id="id00287">"Hurrah!  Well done, little one!  There it is, sticking in yonder
tree."</p>

<h2 id="id00288" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p id="id00289">"As far as you like, Robin," said the outlaw, "only you must be
wise.  Don't go far enough to lose your way.  Learn the forest by
degrees.  Some day you will not be able to lose yourself."</p>

<p id="id00290">"But suppose I did lose myself," said the boy; "what then?"</p>

<p id="id00291">"I should have to tell Little John to bring all my merry men to
look for you, and Maid Marian here would sit at home and cry till
you were found."</p>

<p id="id00292">"Then I will not lose myself," said Robin.  And he always
remembered his promise when he took his bow and arrows and, with
his sword hanging from his belt, went away from the outlaws' camp
for a long ramble.</p>

<p id="id00293">His bow was just as high as he was himself, that being the rule in
archery, and his arrows, beautifully made by Little John, were just
half the length of his bow.</p>

<p id="id00294">As to his sword, that was a dagger in a green shark-skin sheath
given to him by Robin Hood, who said rightly enough that it was
quite big enough for him.</p>

<p id="id00295">Maid Marian found a suitable buckle for the belt, one which Little
John cut out of a very soft piece of deer-skin, the same skin
forming the cross-belt which went over the boy's shoulder and
supported his horn.</p>

<p id="id00296">For he was supplied with a horn as well, this being necessary in
the forest, and Robin Hood himself taught him in the evenings how
to blow the calls by fitting his lips to the mouthpiece and
altering the tone by placing his hand inside the silver rim which
formed the mouth.</p>

<p id="id00297">It was not easy, but the little fellow soon learned.  All the same,
though, he made some strange sounds at first, bad enough, Little
John declared, to give one of Maid Marian's cows the tooth-ache,
and frighten the herds of deer farther and farther away.</p>

<p id="id00298">That was only at the first, for young Robin very soon became quite
a woodman, learning fast to sound his horn, to shoot and hit his
mark, and to find his way through the great wilderness of open
moorland and shady trees.</p>

<p id="id00299">But it was more than once that he lost his way, for the trees and
beaten tracks were so much alike and all was so beautiful that it
was easy to wander on and forget all about finding the way back
through the sun-dappled shades.</p>

<p id="id00300">And so it happened that one morning when the outlaw band had gone
off hunting, to bring back a couple of fat deer for Robin Hood's
larder, young Robin started by himself, bow in hand, down one of
the lovely beech glades, and had soon gone farther than he had been
before.</p>

<p id="id00301">The squirrels dropped the beech mast and dashed away through the
trees, to chop and scold at him; the rabbits started from out of
the ferns and raced away fast, showing the under part of their
white cotton tails, before they plunged into their shady burrows;
and twice over, as the boy softly passed out of the shade into some
sunny opening, he came upon little groups of deer—beautiful
large-eyed thin-legged does, with their fawns—grazing peacefully
on the soft grass which grew in patches between the tufts of golden
prickly furze, for they were safe enough, the huntsmen being gone
in search of the lordly bucks, with their tall flattened horns if
they were fallow deer, small, round, and sharply pointed if they
were roes.</p>

<p id="id00302">There was always something fresh to see, and he who went slowly and
softly through the forest saw most.  At such times as this young
Robin would stop short to watch the grazing deer and fawns with
their softly dappled hides, till all at once a pair of sharp blue
eyes would spy him out, and the jay who owned those eyes would set
up his soft speckled crest, show his fierce black moustachios, and
shout an alarm again in a harsh voice—"Here's a boy! here's a
boy!" and the does would leave off eating, throw up their heads,
and away the little herd would go, nip—nip—nip, in a series of
bounds, just as if their thin legs were so many springs, their
black hoofs coming down close together and just touching the short
elastic grass, which seemed to send them off again.</p>

<p id="id00303">"I wish they wouldn't be afraid of me," young Robin said.  "I
shouldn't hurt them."</p>

<p id="id00304">But the does and fawns did not know that, for as Robin said this he
was fitting an arrow to his bow-string, and threatening to send it
flying after the shrieking jay which had given the alarm.  He
forgot, too, that he had eaten heartily of delicious roasted fawn
only a few days before.</p>

<p id="id00305">As he wandered on through glades where the sun seemed to send rays
of glowing silver down through the oak or beech leaves as if to
fill the golden cups which grew beneath them among the soft green
moss, he would come out suddenly perhaps on one of the sunny forest
pools, perhaps where the water was half covered with broad flat
leaves, among which were silver blossoms, in other places golden,
with arrow weed at the sides, along with whispering reeds and
sword-shaped iris plants.  There beneath the floating leaves great
golden-sided carp and tench floated, and sometimes a fierce-eyed
green-splashed pike, while over all flitted and darted upon gauzy
wings beautiful dragon-flies, chasing the tiny gnats—blue, brown,
golden, and golden-green—and now and then encountering and making
their wings rustle as they touched in rapid flight.  Then as he
stood with his hand resting against a tree trunk, peering forward,
a curious little head with bright crimson eyes divided the sedge or
reeds growing in the water, its owner looking out to see if there
was any danger; and as it looked, Robin could see that the bird's
beak seemed to be continued right up into a fiat red plate between
its eyes.</p>

<p id="id00307">Then it came sailing out, swimming by means of its long thin legs
and toes, coming right into the opening, looking of a dark shiny
brownish green, all but its stunted tail, the under part of which
was pure white, with a black band across.</p>

<p id="id00308">Little John told him afterwards that it was a moor-hen, even if it
was a cock bird.  It was, not this which took so much of Robin's
attention, but the seven or eight little dark balls which followed
it out along one of the lanes of open water, swimming here and
there and making dabs with their little beaks at the insects
gliding about the top.</p>

<p id="id00309">It was so quiet and seemed so safe that directly after the reeds
parted again and another bird swam out from among the sheltering
reeds.  Robin knew this directly as a drake, but he had never
before seen one with such a gloriously green head, rich
chestnut-colored breast, soft gray back, or glistening metallic
purple wing spots.</p>

<p id="id00310">Robin could have sent a sharp-pointed arrow at this beautiful bird,
and perhaps have killed it, for he knew well that roast duck or
drake is very nice stuffed with sage and onions, and with green
peas to eat therewith; but he never thought of using his bow, and
he was content to feast his eyes upon the bird's beauty and watch
its motions.</p>
