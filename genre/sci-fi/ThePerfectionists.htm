<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Frank Pembroke</span> sat behind
the desk of his shabby
little office over Lemark's Liquors
in downtown Los Angeles and
waited for his first customer. He
had been in business for a week
and as yet had had no callers.
Therefore, it was with a mingled
sense of excitement and satisfaction
that he greeted the tall,
dark, smooth-faced figure that
came up the stairs and into the
office shortly before noon.</p>

<p>"Good day, sir," said Pembroke
with an amiable smile. "I
see my advertisement has interested
you. Please stand in that
corner for just a moment."</p>

<p>Opening the desk drawer,
which was almost empty, Pembroke
removed an automatic pistol
fitted with a silencer. Pointing
it at the amazed customer, he
fired four .22 caliber longs into
the narrow chest. Then he made
a telephone call and sat down to
wait. He wondered how long it
would be before his next client
would arrive.</p>

<hr />

<p>The series of events leading up
to Pembroke's present occupation
had commenced on a dismal,
overcast evening in the South
Pacific a year earlier. Bound for
Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,
the Colombian tramp
steamer <i>Elena Mia</i> had encountered
a dense greenish fog which
seemed vaguely redolent of citrus
trees. Standing on the forward
deck, Pembroke was one of the
first to perceive the peculiar odor
and to spot the immense gray
hulk wallowing in the murky distance.</p>

<p>Then the explosion had come,
from far below the waterline,
and the decks were awash with
frantic crewmen, officers, and the
handful of passengers. Only two
lifeboats were launched before
the <i>Elena Mia</i> went down. Pembroke
was in the second. The
roar of the sinking ship was the
last thing he heard for some
time.</p>

<p>Pembroke came as close to being
a professional adventurer as
one can in these days of regimented
travel, organized peril,
and political restriction. He had
made for himself a substantial
fortune through speculation in a
great variety of properties, real
and otherwise. Life had given
him much and demanded little,
which was perhaps the reason
for his restiveness.</p>

<hr />

<p>Loyalty to person or to people
was a trait Pembroke had never
recognized in himself, nor had it
ever been expected of him. And
yet he greatly envied those
staunch patriots and lovers who
could find it in themselves to
elevate the glory and safety of
others above that of themselves.</p>

<p>Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke
adapted quickly to the situation
in which he found himself
when he regained consciousness.
He awoke in a small room in
what appeared to be a typical
modern American hotel. The wallet
in his pocket contained exactly
what it should, approximately
three hundred dollars.
His next thought was of food.
He left the room and descended
via the elevator to the restaurant.
Here he observed that it
was early afternoon. Ordering
a full dinner, for he was unusually
hungry, he began to study the
others in the restaurant.</p>

<p>Many of the faces seemed familiar;
the crew of the ship,
probably. He also recognized several
of the passengers. However,
he made no attempt to speak to
them. After his meal, he bought
a good corona and went for a
walk. His situation could have
been any small western American
seacoast city. He heard the hiss
of the ocean in the direction the
afternoon sun was taking. In his
full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching
the beach.</p>

<p>On the sand he saw a number
of sun bathers. One in particular,
an attractive woman of about
thirty, tossed back her long,
chestnut locks and gazed up intently
at Pembroke as he passed.
Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous
an invitation. He halted
and stared down at her for a few
moments.</p>

<p>"You are looking for someone?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"Much of the time," said the
man.</p>

<p>"Could it be me?"</p>

<p>"It could be."</p>

<p>"Yet you seem unsure," she
said.</p>

<p>Pembroke smiled, uneasily.
There was something not entirely
normal about her conversation.
Though the rest of her compensated
for that.</p>

<p>"Tell me what's wrong with
me," she went on urgently. "I'm
not good enough, am I? I mean,
there's something wrong with
the way I look or act. Isn't there?
Please help me, please!"</p>

<p>"You're not casual enough, for
one thing," said Pembroke, deciding
to play along with her for
the moment. "You're too tense.
Also you're a bit knock-kneed,
not that it matters. Is that what
you wanted to hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I mean, I suppose
so. I can try to be more casual.
But I don't know what to do
about my knees," she said wistfully,
staring across at the
smooth, tan limbs. "Do you think
I'm okay otherwise? I mean, as a
whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh,
please tell me."</p>

<p>"How about talking it over at
supper tonight?" Pembroke proposed.
"Maybe with less distraction
I'll have a better picture of
you&mdash;as a whole."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's very generous of
you," the woman told him. She
scribbled a name and an address
on a small piece of paper and
handed it to him. "Any time
after six," she said.</p>

<p>Pembroke left the beach and
walked through several small
specialty shops. He tried to get
the woman off his mind, but the
oddness of her conversation continued
to bother him. She was
right about being different, but
it was her concern about being
different that made her so. How
to explain <i>that</i> to her?</p>

<hr />

<p>Then he saw the weird little
glass statuette among the usual
bric-a-brac. It rather resembled
a ground hog, had seven fingers
on each of its six limbs, and
smiled up at him as he stared.</p>

<p>"Can I help you, sir?" a middle-aged
saleswoman inquired.
"Oh, good heavens, whatever is
that thing doing here?"</p>

<p>Pembroke watched with lifted
eyebrows as the clerk whisked
the bizarre statuette underneath
the counter.</p>

<p>"What the hell was that?"
Pembroke demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know&mdash;or don't you?
Oh, my," she concluded, "are you
one of the&mdash;strangers?"</p>

<p>"And if I were?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd certainly appreciate
it if you'd tell me how I walk."</p>

<hr />

<p>She came around in front of
the counter and strutted back
and forth a few times.</p>

<p>"They tell me I lean too far
forward," she confided. "But I
should think you'd fall down if
you didn't."</p>

<p>"Don't try to go so fast and
you won't fall down," suggested
Pembroke. "You're in too much
of a hurry. Also those fake flowers
on your blouse make you look
frumpy."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm supposed to look
frumpy," the woman retorted.
"That's the type of person I am.
But you can look frumpy and still
walk natural, can't you? Everyone
says you can."</p>

<p>"Well, they've got a point,"
said Pembroke. "Incidentally,
just where are we, anyway?
What city is this?"</p>

<p>"Puerto Pacifico," she told
him. "Isn't that a lovely name?
It means peaceful port. In Spanish."</p>

<p>That was fine. At least he now
knew where he was. But as he
left the shop he began checking
off every west coast state, city,
town, and inlet. None, to the best
of his knowledge, was called
Puerto Pacifico.</p>

<p>He headed for the nearest
service station and asked for a
map. The attendant gave him one
which showed the city, but nothing
beyond.</p>

<p>"Which way is it to San Francisco?"
asked Pembroke.</p>

<p>"That all depends on where
you are," the boy returned.</p>

<p>"Okay, then where am I?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, there's a customer,"
the boy said. "This is
Puerto Pacifico."</p>

<p>Pembroke watched him hurry
off to service a car with a sense
of having been given the runaround.
To his surprise, the boy
came back a few minutes later
after servicing the automobile.</p>

<p>"Say, I've just figured out who
you are," the youngster told him.
"I'd sure appreciate it if you'd
give me a little help on my lingo.
Also, you gas up the car first,
then try to sell 'em the oil&mdash;right?"</p>

<p>"Right," said Pembroke wearily.
"What's wrong with your
lingo? Other than the fact that
it's not colloquial enough."</p>

<p>"Not enough slang, huh? Well,
I guess I'll have to concentrate
on that. How about the smile?"</p>

<p>"Perfect," Pembroke told him.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" said the boy delightedly.
"Say, come back again,
huh? I sure appreciate the help.
Keep the map."</p>

<p>"Thanks. One more thing,"
Pembroke said. "What's over
that way&mdash;outside the city?"</p>

<p>"Sand."</p>

<p>"How about that way?" he
asked, pointing north. "And that
way?" pointing south.</p>

<p>"More of the same."</p>

<p>"Any railroads?"</p>

<p>"That we ain't got."</p>

<p>"Buses? Airlines?"</p>

<p>The kid shook his head.</p>

<p>"Some city."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A
lot of ships dock here, though."</p>

<p>"All cargo ships, I'll bet. No
passengers," said Pembroke.</p>

<p>"Right," said the attendant,
giving with his perfect smile.</p>

<p>"No getting out of here, is
there?"</p>

<p>"That's for sure," the boy said,
walking away to wait on another
customer. "If you don't like the
place, you've had it."</p>

<hr />

<p>Pembroke returned to the
hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized
one of the <i>Elena Mia's</i> paying
passengers. He was a short,
rectangular little man in his fifties
named Spencer. He sat in a
booth with three young women,
all lovely, all effusive. The topic
of the conversation turned out
to be precisely what Pembroke
had predicted.</p>

<p>"Well, Louisa, I'd say your
only fault is the way you keep
wigglin' your shoulders up 'n'
down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em
straight?"</p>

<p>"I thought it made me look
sexy," the redhead said petulantly.</p>

<p>"Just be yourself, gal," Spencer
drawled, jabbing her intimately
with a fat elbow, "and
you'll qualify."</p>

<p>"Me, me," the blonde with a
feather cut was insisting. "What
is wrong with me?"</p>

<p>"You're perfect, sweetheart,"
he told her, taking her hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, come on," she pleaded.
"Everyone tells me I chew gum
with my mouth open. Don't you
hate that?"</p>

<p>"Naw, that's part of your
charm," Spencer assured her.</p>

<p>"How 'bout me, sugar," asked
the girl with the coal black hair.</p>

<p>"Ah, you're perfect, too. You
are all perfect. I've never seen
such a collection of dolls as parade
around this here city.
C'mon, kids&mdash;how 'bout another
round?"</p>

<p>But the dolls had apparently
lost interest in him. They got up
one by one and walked out of the
bar. Pembroke took his rum and
tonic and moved over to Spencer's
booth.</p>

<p>"Okay if I join you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the fat man.
"Wonder what the hell got into
those babes?"</p>

<p>"You said they were perfect.
They know they're not. You've
got to be rough with them in this
town," said Pembroke. "That's
all they want from us."</p>

<p>"Mister, you've been doing
some thinkin', I can see," said
Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.
"Maybe you've figured
out where we are."</p>

<p>"Your bet's as good as mine,"
said Pembroke. "It's not Wellington,
and it's not Brisbane, and
it's not Long Beach, and it's not
Tahiti. There are a lot of places
it's not. But where the hell it is,
you tell me.</p>

<p>"And, by the way," he added,
"I hope you like it in Puerto
Pacifico. Because there isn't any
place to go from here and there
isn't any way to get there if
there were."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, gentlemen, but
I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the
hotel. I would be very grateful if
you would give me a few minutes
of honest criticism."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, not you, too," groaned
Spencer. "Look, Joe, what's
the gag?"</p>

<p>"You are newcomers, Mr.
Spencer," Valencia explained.
"You are therefore in an excellent
position to point out our
faults as you see them."</p>

<p>"Well, so what?" demanded
Spencer. "I've got more important
things to do than to worry
about your troubles. You look
okay to me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Valencia," said Pembroke.
"I've noticed that you
walk with a very slight limp. If
you have a bad leg, I should
think you would do better to develop
a more pronounced limp.
Otherwise, you may appear to
be self-conscious about it."</p>

<hr />

<p>Spencer opened his mouth to
protest, but saw with amazement
that it was exactly this that
Valencia was seeking. Pembroke
was amused at his companion's
reaction but observed that Spencer
still failed to see the point.</p>

<p>"Also, there is a certain effeminateness
in the way in which
you speak," said Pembroke. "Try
to be a little more direct, a little
more brusque. Speak in a monotone.
It will make you more acceptable."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," said the
manager. "There is much food
for thought in what you have
said, Mr. Pembroke. However,
Mr. Spencer, your value has failed
to prove itself. You have only
yourself to blame. Cooperation is
all we require of you."</p>

<p>Valencia left. Spencer ordered
another martini. Neither he nor
Pembroke spoke for several minutes.</p>

<p>"Somebody's crazy around
here," the fat man muttered
after a few moments. "Is it me,
Frank?"</p>

<p>"No. You just don't belong
here, in this particular place,"
said Pembroke thoughtfully.
"You're the wrong type. But they
couldn't know that ahead of time.
The way they operate it's a
pretty hit-or-miss operation. But
they don't care one bit about us,
Spencer. Consider the men who
went down with the ship. That
was just part of the game."</p>

<p>"What the hell are you sayin'?"
asked Spencer in disbelief.
"You figure <i>they</i> sunk the ship?
Valencia and the waitress and
the three babes? Ah, come on."</p>

<p>"It's what you think that will
determine what you do, Spencer.
I suggest you change your attitude;
play along with them for a
few days till the picture becomes
a little clearer to you. We'll talk
about it again then."</p>

<p>Pembroke rose and started out
of the bar. A policeman entered
and walked directly to Spencer's
table. Loitering at the juke box,
Pembroke overheard the conversation.</p>

<p>"You Spencer?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said the fat
man sullenly.</p>

<p>"What don't you like about
me? The <i>truth</i>, buddy."</p>

<p>"Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong
with you at all, and nothin'll
make me say there is," said Spencer.</p>

<p>"You're the guy, all right. Too
bad, Mac," said the cop.</p>

<p>Pembroke heard the shots as
he strolled casually out into the
brightness of the hotel lobby.
While he waited for the elevator,
he saw them carrying the body
into the street. How many others,
he wondered, had gone out on
their backs during their first day
in Puerto Pacifico?</p>

<hr />

<p>Pembroke shaved, showered,
and put on the new suit and shirt
he had bought. Then he took
Mary Ann, the woman he had
met on the beach, out to dinner.
She would look magnificent even
when fully clothed, he decided,
and the pale chartreuse gown she
wore hardly placed her in that
category. Her conversation seemed
considerably more normal
after the other denizens of
Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had
listened to that afternoon.</p>

<p>After eating they danced for
an hour, had a few more drinks,
then went to Pembroke's room.
He still knew nothing about her
and had almost exhausted his
critical capabilities, but not once
had she become annoyed with
him. She seemed to devour every
factual point of imperfection
about herself that Pembroke
brought to her attention. And,
fantastically enough, she actually
appeared to have overcome every
little imperfection he had been
able to communicate to her.</p>

<p>It was in the privacy of his
room that Pembroke became
aware of just how perfect, physically,
Mary Ann was. Too perfect.
No freckles or moles anywhere
on the visible surface of
her brown skin, which was more
than a mere sampling. Furthermore,
her face and body were
meticulously symmetrical. And
she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.</p>

<p>"With so many beautiful
women in Puerto Pacifico," said
Pembroke probingly, "I find it
hard to understand why there are
so few children."</p>

<p>"Yes, children are decorative,
aren't they," said Mary Ann. "I
do wish there were more of
them."</p>

<p>"Why not have a couple of
your own?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're only given to maternal
types. I'd never get one.
Anyway, I won't ever marry,"
she said. "I'm the paramour
type."</p>

<p>It was obvious that the liquor
had been having some effect.
Either that, or she had a basic
flaw of loquacity that no one else
had discovered. Pembroke decided
he would have to cover his
tracks carefully.</p>

<p>"What type am I?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Silly, you're real. You're not
a type at all."</p>

<p>"Mary Ann, I love you very
much," Pembroke murmured,
gambling everything on this one
throw. "When you go to Earth
I'll miss you terribly."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you'll be dead by
then," she pouted. "So I mustn't
fall in love with you. I don't want
to be miserable."</p>

<p>"If I pretended I was one of
you, if I left on the boat with
you, they'd let me go to Earth
with you. Wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'm sure they would."</p>

<p>"Mary Ann, you have two
other flaws I feel I should mention."</p>

<p>"Yes? Please tell me."</p>

<p>"In the first place," said Pembroke,
"you should be willing to
fall in love with me even if it
will eventually make you unhappy.
How can you be the paramour
type if you refuse to fall in
love foolishly? And when you
have fallen in love, you should be
very loyal."</p>

<p>"I'll try," she said unsurely.
"What else?"</p>

<p>"The other thing is that, as
my mistress, you must never
mention me to anyone. It would
place me in great danger."</p>

<p>"I'll never tell anyone anything
about you," she promised.</p>

<p>"Now try to love me," Pembroke
said, drawing her into his
arms and kissing with little
pleasure the smooth, warm perfection
of her tanned cheeks.
"Love me my sweet, beautiful,
affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour."</p>

<p>Making love to Mary Ann was
something short of ecstasy. Not
for any obvious reason, but because
of subtle little factors that
make a woman a woman. Mary
Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did
not perspire. Mary Ann did not
fatigue gradually but all at once.
Mary Ann breathed regularly
under all circumstances. Mary
Ann talked and talked and talked.
But then, Mary Ann was not
a human being.</p>

<p>When she left the hotel at midnight,
Pembroke was quite sure
that she understood his plan and
that she was irrevocably in love
with him. Tomorrow might bring
his death, but it might also ensure
his escape. After forty-two
years of searching for a passion,
for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank
Pembroke had at last found his.
Earth and the human race that
peopled it. And Mary Ann would
help him to save it.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next morning Pembroke
talked to Valencia about hunting.
He said that he planned to go
shooting out on the desert which
surrounded the city. Valencia
told him that there were no living
creatures anywhere but in
the city. Pembroke said he was
going out anyway.</p>

<p>He picked up Mary Ann at her
apartment and together they
went to a sporting goods store.
As he guessed there was a goodly
selection of firearms, despite the
fact that there was nothing to
hunt and only a single target
range within the city. Everything,
of course, had to be just
like Earth. That, after all, was
the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.</p>

<p>By noon they had rented a
jeep and were well away from
the city. Pembroke and Mary
Ann took turns firing at the paper
targets they had purchased. At
twilight they headed back to the
city. On the outskirts, where the
sand and soil were mixed and no
footprints would be left, Pembroke
hopped off. Mary Ann
would go straight to the police
and report that Pembroke had attacked
her and that she had shot
him. If necessary, she would conduct
the authorities to the place
where they had been target
shooting, but would be unable to
locate the spot where she had
buried the body. Why had she
buried it? Because at first she
was not going to report the incident.
She was frightened. It
was not airtight, but there would
probably be no further investigation.
And they certainly would
not prosecute Mary Ann for killing
an Earthman.</p>

<p>Now Pembroke had himself to
worry about. The first step was
to enter smoothly into the new
life he had planned. It wouldn't
be so comfortable as the previous
one, but should be considerably
safer. He headed slowly for the
"old" part of town, aging his
clothes against buildings and
fences as he walked. He had already
torn the collar of the shirt
and discarded his belt. By morning
his beard would grow to
blacken his face. And he would
look weary and hungry and aimless.
Only the last would be a deception.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two weeks later Pembroke
phoned Mary Ann. The police
had accepted her story without
even checking. And when, when
would she be seeing him again?
He had aroused her passion and
no amount of long-distance love
could requite it. Soon, he assured
her, soon.</p>

<p>"Because, after all, you do owe
me something," she added.</p>

<p>And that was bad because it
sounded as if she had been giving
some womanly thought to the situation.
A little more of that and
she might go to the police again,
this time for vengeance.</p>

<p>Twice during his wanderings
Pembroke had seen the corpses
of Earthmen being carted out of
buildings. They had to be Earthmen
because they bled. Mary Ann
had admitted that she did not.
There would be very few Earthmen
left in Puerto Pacifico, and
it would be simple enough to locate
him if he were reported as
being on the loose. There was
no out but to do away with Mary
Ann.</p>

<p>Pembroke headed for the
beach. He knew she invariably
went there in the afternoon. He
loitered around the stalls where
hot dogs and soft drinks were
sold, leaning against a post in
the hot sun, hat pulled down over
his forehead. Then he noticed
that people all about him were
talking excitedly. They were discussing
a ship. It was leaving
that afternoon. Anyone who
could pass the interview would
be sent to Earth.</p>

<p>Pembroke had visited the
docks every day, without being
able to learn when the great
exodus would take place. Yet he
was certain the first lap would be
by water rather than by spaceship,
since no one he had talked
to in the city had ever heard of
spaceships. In fact, they knew
very little about their masters.</p>

<p>Now the ship had arrived and
was to leave shortly. If there was
any but the most superficial examination,
Pembroke would no
doubt be discovered and exterminated.
But since no one seemed
concerned about anything but his
own speech and behavior, he assumed
that they had all qualified
in every other respect. The reason
for transporting Earth People
to this planet was, of course,
to apply a corrective to any of
the Pacificos' aberrant mannerisms
or articulation. This was
the polishing up phase.</p>

<hr />

<p>Pembroke began hobbling toward
the docks. Almost at once
he found himself face to face
with Mary Ann. She smiled happily
when she recognized him.
<i>That</i> was a good thing.</p>

<p>"It is a sign of poor breeding
to smile at tramps," Pembroke
admonished her in a whisper.
"Walk on ahead."</p>

<p>She obeyed. He followed. The
crowd grew thicker. They neared
the docks and Pembroke saw that
there were now set up on the
roped-off wharves small interviewing
booths. When it was
their turn, he and Mary Ann
each went into separate ones.
Pembroke found himself alone in
the little room.</p>

<p>Then he saw that there was
another entity in his presence
confined beneath a glass dome. It
looked rather like a groundhog
and had seven fingers on each of
its six limbs. But it was larger
and hairier than the glass one
he had seen at the gift store.
With four of its limbs it tapped
on an intricate keyboard in front
of it.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" queried
a metallic voice from a speaker
on the wall.</p>

<p>"I'm Jerry Newton. Got no
middle initial," Pembroke said in
a surly voice.</p>

<p>"Occupation?"</p>

<p>"I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman,
fruit picker, fightin' range
fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.
You name it. Been out of
work for a long time now,
though. Goin' on five months.
These here are hard times, no
matter what they say."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the
Chinese situation?" the voice inquired.</p>

<p>"Which situation's 'at?"</p>

<p>"Where's Seattle?"</p>

<p>"Seattle? State o' Washington."</p>

<p>And so it went for about five
minutes. Then he was told he
had qualified as a satisfactory
surrogate for a mid-twentieth
century American male, itinerant
type.</p>

<p>"You understand your mission,
Newton?" the voice asked. "You
are to establish yourself on
Earth. In time you will receive
instructions. Then you will attack.
You will not see us, your
masters, again until the atmosphere
has been sufficiently chlorinated.
In the meantime, serve
us well."</p>

<p>He stumbled out toward the
docks, then looked about for
Mary Ann. He saw her at last
behind the ropes, her lovely face
in tears.</p>

<p>Then she saw him. Waving
frantically, she called his name
several times. Pembroke mingled
with the crowd moving toward
the ship, ignoring her. But still
the woman persisted in her
shouting.</p>

<p>Sidling up to a well-dressed
man-about-town type, Pembroke
winked at him and snickered.</p>

<p>"You Frank?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hell, no. But some poor
punk's sure red in the face, I'll
bet," the man-about-town said
with a chuckle. "Those high-strung
paramour types always
raising a ruckus. They never do
pass the interview. Don't know
why they even make 'em."</p>

<p>Suddenly Mary Ann was quiet.</p>

<p>"Ambulance squad," Pembroke's
companion explained.
"They'll take her off to the buggy
house for a few days and bring
her out fresh and ignorant as the
day she was assembled. Don't
know why they keep making 'em,
as I say. But I guess there's a
call for that type up there on
Earth."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I reckon there is at
that," said Pembroke, snickering
again as he moved away from the
other. "And why not? Hey?
Why not?"</p>

<p>Pembroke went right on hating
himself, however, till the
night he was deposited in a field
outside of Ensenada, broke but
happy, with two other itinerant
types. They separated in San
Diego, and it was not long before
Pembroke was explaining to the
police how he had drifted far
from the scene of the sinking of
the <i>Elena Mia</i> on a piece of
wreckage, and had been picked
up by a Chilean trawler. How he
had then made his way, with
much suffering, up the coast to
California. Two days later, his
identity established and his circumstances
again solvent, he was
headed for Los Angeles to begin
his save-Earth campaign.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, seated at his battered
desk in the shabby rented office
over Lemark's Liquors, Pembroke
gazed without emotion at
the two demolished Pacificos that
lay sprawled one atop the other
in the corner. His watch said
one-fifteen. The man from the
FBI should arrive soon.</p>

<p>There were footsteps on the
stairs for the third time that
day. Not the brisk, efficient steps
of a federal official, but the hesitant,
self-conscious steps of a
junior clerk type.</p>

<p>Pembroke rose as the young
man appeared at the door. His
face was smooth, unpimpled,
clean-shaven, without sweat on a
warm summer afternoon.</p>

<p>"Are you Dr. Von Schubert?"
the newcomer asked, peering into
the room. "You see, I've got a
problem&mdash;"</p>

<p>The four shots from Pembroke's
pistol solved his problem
effectively. Pembroke tossed his
third victim onto the pile, then
opened a can of lager, quaffing
it appreciatively. Seating himself
once more, he leaned back in
the chair, both feet upon the
desk.</p>

<p>He would be out of business
soon, once the FBI agent had got
there. Pembroke was only in it to
get the proof he would need to
convince people of the truth of
his tale. But in the meantime he
allowed himself to admire the
clipping of the newspaper ad he
had run in all the Los Angeles
papers for the past week. The
little ad that had saved mankind
from God-knew-what insidious
menace. It read:</p>

<p class="illo">ARE YOU IMPERFECT?</p>

<p class="center">LET DR. VON SCHUBERT POINT OUT<br />
YOUR FLAWS</p>

<p class="center">IT IS HIS GOAL TO MAKE YOU THE<br />
AVERAGE FOR YOUR TYPE</p>

<p class="center">FEE&mdash;$3.75</p>

<p class="center">MONEY BACK IF NOT SATISFIED!</p>

<p class="theend">THE END</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
