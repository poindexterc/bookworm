<h3>A Great Change</h3>


<p>"There's no doubt about it, we really must economize somehow!" sighed
Mrs. Woodward helplessly, with her housekeeping book in one hand, and
her bank pass-book in the other, and an array of bills spread out on the
table in front of her. "Children, do you hear what I say? The war will
make a great difference to our income, and we can't&mdash;simply <i>can't</i>&mdash;go
on living in exactly the old way. The sooner we all realize it the
better. I wish I knew where to begin."</p>

<p>"Might knock off going to church, and save the money we give in
collections!" suggested Percy flippantly. "It must tot up to quite a
decent sum in the course of a year, not to mention pew rent!"</p>

<p>His mother cast a reproachful glance at him.</p>

<p>"Now, Percy, <i>do</i> be serious for once! You and Winona are quite old
enough to understand business matters. I must discuss them with
somebody. As I said before, we shall really have to economize somehow,
and the question is where to begin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw some hints in a magazine the other day," volunteered Winona,
hunting among a pile of papers, and fishing up a copy of <i>The
Housewife's Journal</i>. "Here you are! There's a whole article on War
Economies. It says you can halve your expenses if you only try. It gives
ten different recipes. Number One, Dispense with Servants. Oh, goody! I
don't know how the house would get along without Maggie and Mary! Isn't
that rather stiff?"</p>

<p>"It's impossible to be thought of for a moment! I should never dream of
dismissing maids who have lived with me for years. I've read that
article, and it may be practicable for other people, but certainly not
for us. Oh, dear! Some of my friends recommend me to remove to the town,
and others say 'Stay where you are, and keep poultry!'"</p>

<p>"We can't leave Highfield! We were all born here!" objected Winona
decisively.</p>

<p>"And we tried keeping hens some time ago," said Percy. "They laid on an
average three-quarters of an egg a year each, as far as I remember."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we didn't know how to manage them," replied Mrs. Woodward
fretfully. "Percy, leave those papers alone! I didn't tell you to turn
them over. You're mixing them all up, tiresome boy! Don't touch them
again! It's no use trying to discuss business with you children! I shall
write and consult Aunt Harriet. Go away, both of you, now! I want to
have a quiet half-hour."</p>

<p>Aunt Harriet stood to the Woodward family somewhat in the light of a
Delphic oracle. To apply to her was always the very last resource.
Matters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> must have reached a crisis, Winona thought, if they were
obliged to appeal to Aunt Harriet's judgment. She followed Percy into
the garden with a sober look on her face.</p>

<p>"You don't think mother would really leave Highfield?" she asked her
brother anxiously.</p>

<p>"Bunkum!" replied that light-hearted youth. "We always have more or less
of a fuss when my school bills come in. It'll soon fizzle out again!
Don't you fret yourself. Things will jog on as they always have jogged
on. There'll be nothing done, you'll see. Come on and bowl for me,
that's a chubby one!"</p>

<p>"But this time mother really seemed to be in earnest," said Winona
meditatively, as she helped to put up the stumps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodward had been left a widow three years before this story opens.
She was a fair, fragile little woman, still pretty, and pathetically
helpless. She had been accustomed to lean upon her husband, and now, for
lack of firmer support, she leaned upon Winona. Winona was young to act
as prop, and though it flattered her sense of importance, it had put a
row of wrinkles on her girlish forehead. At fifteen she seemed much
older than Percy at sixteen. No one ever dreamt of taking Percy
seriously; he was one of those jolly, easy-going, happy-go-lucky,
unreliable people who saunter through life with no other aim than to
amuse themselves at all costs. To depend upon him was like trusting to a
boat without a bottom. Though nominally the eldest, he had little more
sense of re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>sponsibility than Ernie, the youngest. It was Winona who
shouldered the family burdens.</p>

<p>The Woodwards had always lived at Highfield, and in their opinion it was
the most desirable residence in the whole of Rytonshire. The house was
old enough to be picturesque, but modern enough for comfort. Its quaint
gables, mullioned windows and Cromwellian porch were the joy of
photographers, while the old-fashioned hall, when the big log fire was
lighted, would be hard to beat for coziness. The schoolroom, on the
ground floor, had a separate side entrance on to the lawn, leading
through a small ante-room where boots and coats and cricket bats and
tennis rackets could be kept; the drawing-room had a luxurious ingle
nook with cushioned seats, and all the bedrooms but two had a southern
aspect. As for the big rambling garden, it was full of delightful
old-world flowers that came up year after year: daffodils and violets
and snow-flakes, and clumps of pinks, and orange lilies and Canterbury
bells, and tall Michaelmas daisies, and ribbon grass and royal Osmunda
fern, the sort of flowers that people used to pick in days gone by, put
a paper frill round, and call a nosegay or a posy. There was a lawn for
tennis and cricket, a pond planted with irises and bulrushes, and a wild
corner where crocuses and coltsfoot and golden aconite came up as they
liked in the spring time.</p>

<p>Winona loved this garden with somewhat the same attachment that a French
peasant bears for the soil upon which he has been reared. She rejoiced
in every yard of it. To go away and resign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> it to others would be
tragedy unspeakable. The fear that Aunt Harriet might recommend the
family to leave Highfield was sufficient to darken her horizon
indefinitely. That her mother had written to consult the oracle she was
well aware, for she had been sent to post the letter. She had an
instinctive apprehension that the answer would prove a turning-point in
her career.</p>

<p>For a day or two everything went on as usual. Mrs. Woodward did not
again allude to her difficulties, Percy had conveniently forgotten them,
and the younger children were not aware of their existence. Winona lived
with a black spot dancing before her mental eyes. It was continually
rising up and blotting out the sunshine. On the fourth morning appeared
a letter addressed in an old-fashioned slanting handwriting, and bearing
the Seaton post mark. Mrs. Woodward read it in silence, and left her
toast unfinished. Aunt Harriet's communications generally upset her for
the day.</p>

<p>"Come here, Winona," she said agitatedly, after breakfast. "Oh, dear, I
wish I knew what to do! It's so very unexpected, but of course it would
be a splendid thing for you. If only I could consult somebody! I suppose
girls nowadays will have to learn to support themselves, and the war
will alter everything, but I'd always meant you to stop at home and look
after the little ones for me, and it's very&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does Aunt Harriet say, mother?" interrupted Winona, with a catch
in her throat.</p>

<p>"She says a great deal, and I dare say she's right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> Oh, this terrible
war! Things were so different when I was a girl! You might as well read
the letter for yourself, as it concerns you. I always think she's hard
on Percy, poor lad! I was afraid the children were too noisy the last
time she was here, but they wouldn't keep quiet. I'm sure I try to do my
best all round, and you know, Winona, how I said Aunt Harriet&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Winona was already devouring the letter.</p>


<p style="text-align: right"><span style="margin-right: 5em;">"10 Abbey Close,</span><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Seaton,</span><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span style="margin-right: 0em;">"August 26th.</span><br /></p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Florita</span>,&mdash;You are quite right to consult me in your
difficulties, and are welcome to any advice which I am able to offer
you. I am sorry to hear of your financial embarrassments, but I am not
surprised. The present increase in the cost of living, and extra
taxation, will make retrenchments necessary to everybody. In the
circumstances I should not advise you to leave Highfield. ("Oh, thank
goodness!" ejaculated Winona.) The expense of a removal would probably
cancel what you would otherwise save. Neither should I recommend you to
take Percy from Longworth College and send him daily to be coached by
your parish curate. From my knowledge of his character I consider the
discipline of a public school to be indispensable if he is to grow into
worthy manhood, and sooner than allow the wholesome restraint of his
house master to be removed at this critical portion of his life, I will
myself defray half the cost of his maintenance for the next two years.</p>

<p>"Now as regards Winona. I believe she has ability, and it is high time
to begin to think seriously what you mean to do with her. In the future
women will have to depend upon themselves, and I consider that all girls
should be trained to gain their own living. The foundation of every
career is a good education&mdash;without this it is impossible to build at
all, and Winona certainly cannot obtain it if she remains at home. The
new High School at Seaton is offering two open Scholarships to girls
resident in the County, the examination for which is on September 8th. I
propose that Winona enters for this examination, and that if she should
be a successful candidate, she should come to live with me during the
period of her attendance at the High School. The education is the best
possible, there is a prospect of a University Scholarship to be competed
for, and every help and encouragement is given to the girls in their
choice of a career. With Winona off your hands, I should suggest that
you should engage a competent nursery governess to teach the younger
children the elements of order and discipline. I would gladly pay her
salary on the understanding that I should myself select her.</p>

<p>"Trusting that these proposals may be of some service, and hoping to
hear a better account of your health,</p>


<p style="text-align: right"><span style="margin-right: 15em;">"I remain,</span><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span style="margin-right: 10em;">"Your affectionate Aunt</span><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span style="margin-right: 5em;">"and Godmother,</span><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span style="margin-right: 0em;">"Harriet Beach."</span><br /><br /><br />
</p>


<p>Winona laid down the letter with an agitated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> gasp. The proposition
almost took her breath away.</p>

<p>"What an idea!" she exclaimed indignantly. "Mother, of course you won't
even dream of it for an instant! I'd <i>hate</i> to go and live with Aunt
Harriet. It's not to be thought of!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, Winona!" wavered Mrs. Woodward. "We must look at it
from all sides, and perhaps Aunt Harriet's right, and it really would be
for the best. Miss Harmon's a poor teacher, and I'm sure your music, at
any rate, is not a credit to her. You played that last piece shockingly
out of time. You know you said yourself that you were getting beyond
Miss Harmon!"</p>

<p>Whatever impeachments Winona may have brought against her teacher, she
was certainly not prepared to admit them now. She rejected the project
of the Seaton High School with the utmost energy and determination,
bringing into the fray all that force of character which her mother
lacked. Poor Mrs. Woodward vacillated feebly&mdash;she was generally swayed
by whoever was nearest at the moment&mdash;and I verily believe Winona's
arguments would have prevailed, and the whole scheme would have been
abandoned, had not Mr. Joynson opportunely happened to turn up.</p>

<p>Mr. Joynson was a solicitor, and the trustee of Mrs. Woodward's
property. He managed most of her business affairs, and some of her
private ones as well. She had confidence in his judgment, and she at
once thankfully submitted the question of Winona's future to his
decision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"The very thing for her!" he declared. "Do her a world of good to go to
a proper school. She's frittering her time away here. Send her to Seaton
by all means. What are you to do without her? Nonsense! Nobody's
indispensable&mdash;especially a girl of fifteen! Pack her off as soon as you
can. Doesn't want to go? Oh, she'll sing a different song when once she
gets there, you'll see!"</p>

<p>Thus supported by masculine authority, Mrs. Woodward settled the
question in the affirmative, and replied to her aunt by return of post.</p>

<p>Naturally such a stupendous event as the exodus of Winona made a
sensation in the household.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the rum shows!" exclaimed Percy. "You and Aunt Harriet in
double harness! It beats me altogether!"</p>

<p>"It's atrocious!" groaned Winona. "I'm a victim sacrificed for the good
of the family. Oh! why couldn't mother have thought of some other way of
economizing? I don't want to win scholarships and go in for a career!"</p>

<p>"Buck up! Perhaps you won't win! There'll be others in for the exam.,
you bet! You'll probably fail, and come whining home like a whipped
puppy with its tail between its legs!"</p>

<p>"Indeed I shan't!" flared Winona indignantly. "I've a little more spirit
than that, thank you! And why should you imagine I'm going to fail? I
suppose I've as much brains as most people!"</p>

<p>"That's right! Upset the pepper-pot! I was only trying to comfort you!"
teased Percy. "In my opinion you'll be returned like a bad halfpenny,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
or one of those articles 'of no use to anybody except the owner.' Aunt
Harriet will be cheated of her prey after all!"</p>

<p>"If Win goes away, I shall be the eldest daughter at home," said Letty
airily, shaking out her short skirts. "I'll sit at the end of the table,
and pour out tea if mother has a headache, and unlock the apple room,
and use the best inkpot if I like, and have first innings at the piano."</p>

<p>"You forget about the nursery governess," retorted Winona. "If I go, she
comes, and you'll find you've exchanged King Log for King Stork. Oh,
very well, just wait and see! It won't be as idyllic as you imagine. I
shall be saved the trouble of looking after you, at any rate."</p>

<p>"What I'm trying to ascertain, madam," said Percy blandly, "is whether
your ladyship wishes to take up your residence in Seaton or not. With
the usual perversity of your sex you pursue a pig policy. When I venture
to picture you seated at the board of your venerable aunt, you protest
you are a sacrifice; when, on the other hand, I suggest your return to
the bosom of your family, you revile me equally."</p>

<p>"You're the most unsympathetic <i>beast</i> I've ever met!" declared Winona
aggrievedly.</p>

<p>When she analyzed her feelings, however, she was obliged to allow that
they were mixed. Though the prospect of settling down at Seaton filled
her with dismay, Percy's gibe at her probable failure touched her pride.
Winona had always been counted as the clever member of the family. It
would be too ignominious to be sent home labeled unfit. She set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> her
teeth and clenched her fists at the bare notion.</p>

<p>"I'll show them all what I can do if I take a thing up!" she resolved.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mrs. Woodward was immersed in the subject of clothing.
Every post brought her boxes of patterns, amongst which she hesitated,
lost in choice.</p>

<p>"If I knew whether you're really going to stay at Seaton or not, it
would make all the difference, Winona," she fluttered. "It's no use
buying you these new things if you're only to wear them at home, but I'd
make an effort to send you nice to Aunt Harriet's. I know she'll
criticize everything you have on. Dear me, I think I'd better risk it!
It would be such a nuisance to have to write for the patterns all over
again, and how could I get your dresses fitted when you weren't here to
be tried on? Miss Jones is at liberty now, and can come for a week's
sewing, but she'll probably be busy if I want her later. Now tell me,
which do you really think is the prettier of these two shades? I like
the fawn, but I believe the material will spot. What have you done with
